  phenomena and systems, such as projectile motion and airplanes, with the
  goal of giving you a solid understanding of their real-life behavior. This
  understanding will help you to model these or similar systems accurately in
  your games. Instead of relying on purely idealized formulas, we’ll present a
  wide variety of practical formulas and data that you can use. We’ve chosen
  the examples in this and later chapters to illustrate common forces and
  phenomena that exists in many systems, not just the ones we’ll be discussing
  here. For example, while <a class="xref" href="ch16.html" title="Chapter 16. Ships and Boats">Chapter 16</a>, “Ships and
  Boats,” discusses buoyancy in detail, buoyancy is not limited to ships; any
  object immersed in a fluid experiences buoyant forces. The same applies for
  the topics discussed in this chapter and <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Aircraft">Chapter 15</a>, <a class="xref" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. Cars and Hovercraft">Chapter 17</a>, <a class="xref" href="ch18.html" title="Chapter 18. Guns and Explosions">Chapter 18</a>,
  and <a class="xref" href="ch19.html" title="Chapter 19. Sports">Chapter 19</a>.</p><p>Once you understand what’s supposed to happen with these and similar
  systems, you’ll be in a better position to interpret your simulation results
  to determine if they make sense—that is, if they are realistic enough.
  You’ll also be better educated on what factors are most important for a
  given system such that you can make appropriate simplifying assumptions to
  help ease your effort. Basically, when designing and optimizing your code,
  you’ll know where to cut things out without sacrificing realism. This gets
  into the subject <a id="I_indexterm6_id315553" class="indexterm"/>of <span class="emphasis"><em>parameter tuning</em></span>.</p><p>Over the next few chapters, we want to give you enough of an
  understanding of certain physical phenomenon such that you can tune your
  models for the desired behavior. If you are modeling several similar objects
  in your simulation but want each one to behave slightly differently, then
  you have to tune the forces that get applied to each object in order to
  achieve the varying behavior. Since forces govern the behavior of objects in
  your simulations, we’ll be focusing on force calculations with the intent of
  showing you how and why certain forces are what they are instead of simply
  using the idealized formulas discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Force">Chapter 3</a>.
  Parameter tuning isn’t just limited to tuning your model’s behavior—it also
  involves dealing with numerical issues, such as numerical stability in your
  integration algorithms. We’ll discuss these issues more when we show you
  several simulation examples in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Real-Time Simulations">Chapter 7</a>
  through <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Physics Engines">Chapter 14</a>.</p><p>We’ve devoted this entire chapter to projectile motion because so many
  physical problems that may find their way into your games fall in this
  category. Further, the forces governing projectile motion affect many other
  systems that aren’t necessarily projectiles—for example, the drag force
  experienced by projectiles is similar to that experienced by airplanes,
  cars, or any other object moving through a fluid such as air or
  water.</p><p>A projectile is an object that is placed in motion by a force acting
  over a very short period of time, which, as you know from <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Collisions">Chapter 5</a>, is also called an impulse. <a id="I_indexterm6_id315606" class="indexterm"/>After the projectile is set in motion by the initial impulse
  during the launching phase, the projectile enters into the projectile motion
  phase, where there is no longer a thrust or propulsive force acting on it.
  As you know already from the examples presented in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Kinematics">Chapter 2</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Kinetics">Chapter 4</a>, there are other
  forces that act on projectiles. (For the moment, we’re not talking about
  self-propelled “projectiles” such as rockets since, due to their propulsive
  force, they don’t follow “classical” projectile motion until after they’ve
  expended their fuel.)</p><p>In the simplest case, neglecting aerodynamic effects, the only force
  acting on a projectile other than the initial impulsive force is <a id="I_indexterm6_id315636" class="indexterm"/>gravitation. For situations where the projectile is near the
  earth’s surface, the problem reduces to a constant acceleration problem.
  Assuming that the earth’s surface is flat—that is, that its curvature is
  large compared to the range of the projectile—the following statements
  describe projectile motion:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The trajectory is parabolic.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The maximum range, for a given launch velocity, occurs when the

    to consider these other forces and treat the problem as we <a id="I_indexterm6_id317266" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id317276" class="indexterm"/>did in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Kinetics">Chapter 4</a>’s example.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Drag"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="drag">Drag</h2></div></div></div><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Force">Chapter 3</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Kinetics">Chapter 4</a>, we
    <a id="pr6.2" class="indexterm"/><a id="fl6.2" class="indexterm"/>showed you the idealized formulas for viscous fluid dynamic
    drag as well as how to implement drag in the equations of motion for a
    projectile. This was illustrated in the example program discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Kinetics">Chapter 4</a>. Recall that the drag force is a vector just like
    any other force and that it acts on the line of action of the velocity
    vector but in a direction opposing velocity. While those formulas work in
    a game simulation, as we said before, they don’t tell the whole story.
    While we can’t treat the subject of fluid dynamics in its entirety in this
    book, we do want to give you a better understanding of drag than just the
    simple idealized equation presented earlier.</p><p>Analytical methods can show that the drag on an object moving
    through a fluid is proportional to its speed, size, shape, and the density
    and viscosity of the fluid through which it is moving. You can also come
    to these conclusions by drawing on your own real-life experience. For
    example, when waving your hand through the air, you feel very little
    resistance; however, if you put your hand out of a car window traveling at
    100 km/h, then you feel much greater resistance (drag force) on your hand.
    This is because drag is <a id="I_indexterm6_id317370" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id317380" class="indexterm"/>speed dependent. When you wave your hand underwater—say, in
    a swimming pool—you’ll feel a greater drag force on your hand than you do
    when waving it in the air. This is because water is more dense and viscous
    than air. As you wave your hand underwater, you’ll notice a significant
    difference in drag depending on the orientation of your hand. If your palm
    is in line with the direction of motion—that is, you are leading with your
    palm—then you’ll feel a greater drag force than you would if your hand
    were turned 90 degrees as though you were executing a karate chop through
    the water. This tells you that drag is a function of the shape of the
    object. You get the idea.</p><p>To facilitate our discussion of fluid dynamic drag, let’s look at
    the flow around a <a id="sp6.2" class="indexterm"/><a id="fls6.2" class="indexterm"/>sphere moving through a fluid such as air or water. If the
    sphere is moving slowly through the fluid, the flow pattern around the

    <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span><sub>l</sub>, and will decrease around
    the leading side of the sphere and then start to increase again around the
    back of the sphere. In an ideal fluid with no friction, the pressure is
    fully recovered behind the sphere and there is a trailing stagnation
    point, <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span><sub>t</sub>, whose pressure is
    equal to the pressure at the leading stagnation point. Since the pressure
    fore and aft of the sphere is equal and opposite, there is no net drag

    at the stagnation points since the fluid velocity is greater over the top

    Since a certain amount of fluid is <span class="emphasis"><em>sticking</em></span> to the
    sphere, you can think of this as the energy required to accelerate the
    fluid and move it along with the sphere. (If the flow within this boundary
    layer is laminar, then the viscous shear stress between fluid “layers”
    gives rise to friction drag. When the flow is turbulent, the velocity
    gradient and thus the transfer of momentum gives rise to friction
    drag.)</p><p>Moving further aft along the sphere, the boundary layer grows in
    thickness and will not be able to maintain its adherence to the sphere
    surface, and it will separate at some point. Beyond <a id="I_indexterm6_id317685" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id317695" class="indexterm"/>this <span class="emphasis"><em>separation point</em></span>, the flow will be

    that represents the speed of fluid flow around an object. It’s a little
    more than just a speed measure, since it includes a characteristic length
    for the object and the viscosity and density of the fluid. <a id="I_indexterm6_id317916" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id317924" class="indexterm"/>The formula for the Reynolds number is:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>n</sub> = (v L)/υ</td></tr></table><p>or,</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>n</sub> = (v L ρ)/µ</td></tr></table><p>where <span class="emphasis"><em>v</em></span> is speed, <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span> is a
    characteristic length of the object (diameter for a sphere),
    <span class="emphasis"><em>υ</em></span> is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, ρ is the
    fluid mass density, and µ is the absolute viscosity of the fluid. For the
    Reynolds number to work out as a dimensionless number velocity, length and
    kinematic viscosity must have units of m/s, m, and
    m<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively, within the SI
    system.</p><p>This number is useful for non-dimensionalizing data measured from
    tests on an object of given size (like a model) such that you can scale
    the data to estimate the data for similar objects of different size. Here
    “similar” means that the objects are geometrically similar, just different
    scales, and that the flow pattern around the objects is similar. For a
    sphere the characteristic length is diameter, so you can use drag data
    obtained from a small model sphere of given diameter to estimate the drag
    for a larger sphere of different diameter. A more useful application of
    this scaling technique is estimating the viscous drag on ship or airplane
    appendages based on model test data obtained from wind tunnel or tow tank
    experiments.</p><p>The Reynolds number is used as an indicator of the nature of fluid
    flow. A low Reynolds number generally indicates laminar flow, while a high
    Reynolds number generally indicates turbulent flow. Somewhere in between,
    there is a transition range where the flow makes the transition from
    laminar to turbulent flow. For carefully controlled experiments, this
    transition (<span class="emphasis"><em>critical</em></span>) Reynolds number can
    consistently be determined. However, in general the ambient flow field
    around an object—that is, whether it has low or high turbulence—will
    affect when this transition occurs. Further, the transition Reynolds
    number is specific to the type of problem being investigated (for example,
    whether you’re looking at flow within pipes, the flow around a ship, or
    the flow around an airplane, etc.).</p><p>We calculate the total <a id="I_indexterm6_id318014" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id318025" class="indexterm"/>drag coefficient,

    typically the projected frontal area of the sphere, which is equal to the
    area of a circle of diameter equal to that of the sphere. By comparison,
    for ship hulls, <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> is typically taken as the
    underwater surface area of the hull. If you work out the units on the
    righthand side of this equation, you’ll see that the drag coefficient is
    nondimensional (i.e., it has no units).</p><p>Given the total drag coefficient, you can estimate the total

    available—namely, the total drag coefficient, density, velocity, and area.
    Note the dependence of total resistance on velocity squared. To get
    <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span><sub>t</sub> in units of newtons (N),
    you must have velocity in m/s, area in m<sup>2</sup>, and

    couple of observations. First, you can see that the total drag coefficient
    decreases as the Reynolds number increases. This is due to the formation
    of the separation point and its subsequent move aft on the sphere as the
    Reynolds number increases and the relative reduction in pressure drag, as
    discussed previously. At a Reynolds number of approximately 250,000, there
    is a dramatic reduction in drag. This is a result of the flow becoming
    fully turbulent with a corresponding reduction in pressure <a id="I_indexterm6_id318155" class="indexterm"/>drag.</p><p>In the <code class="literal">Cannon2</code> example in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Kinetics">Chapter 4</a>, we <a id="I_indexterm6_id318182" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id318191" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id318201" class="indexterm"/>implemented the ideal formula for air drag on the
    projectile. In that case we used a constant value of drag coefficient that
    was arbitrarily defined. As we said earlier, it would be better to use the
    formula presented in this chapter for total drag along with the total drag
    coefficient data shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#total_drag_coefficient_for_a_smooth_sphe" title="Figure 6-9. Total drag coefficient for a smooth sphere versus Reynolds number">Figure 6-9</a> to estimate the drag
    on the projectile. While this is more “accurate,” it does complicate
    matters for you. Specifically, the drag coefficient is now a function of
    the <a id="I_indexterm6_id318221" class="indexterm"/>Reynolds number, which is a function of velocity. You’ll
    have to set up a table of drag coefficients versus the Reynolds number and
    interpolate this table given the Reynolds number calculated at each time
    step. As an alternative, you can fit the drag coefficient data to a curve
    to derive a formula that you can use instead; however, the drag
    coefficient data may be such that you’ll have to use a piecewise approach
    and derive curve fits for each segment of the drag coefficient curve. The
    sphere data presented herein is one such case. The data does not lend
    itself nicely to a single polynomial curve fit over the full range of the
    Reynolds number. In such cases, you’ll end up with a handful of formulas
    for drag coefficient, with each formula valid over a limited range of
    Reynolds numbers.</p><p>While the <code class="literal">Cannon2</code> example does
    have its limitations, it is useful to see the effects of drag on the
    trajectory of the projectile. The obvious effect is that the trajectory is
    no longer parabolic. You can see in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#cannon2_example_comma_trajectories" title="Figure 6-10. Cannon2 example, trajectories">Figure 6-10</a> that the trajectory
    appears to drop off much more sharply when the projectile is making its

    objects in free fall as well) is the fact that drag will limit the maximum
    vertical velocity attainable. This limit is the so-called
    <span class="emphasis"><em>terminal velocity</em></span>. <a id="I_indexterm6_id318292" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id318299" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id318309" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id318318" class="indexterm"/>Consider an object in free fall for a moment. As the object
    accelerates toward the earth at the gravitation acceleration, its velocity
    increases. As velocity increases, so does drag since drag is a function of
    velocity. At some speed the drag force retarding the object’s motion will
    increase to a point where it is equal to the gravitational force that’s
    pulling the object toward the earth. In the absence of any other forces
    that may affect motion, the net acceleration on the object is 0, and it
    continues its descent at the constant terminal velocity.</p><p>Let us illustrate this further. Go back to the formula we derived
    for the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> component (vertical component) of velocity
    for the projectile modeled in the <code class="literal">Cannon2</code> example. Here it is again so you don’t

    assumed a mass of 100, a drag coefficient of 30, and an initial velocity

      generally apply to any object moving through a fluid. Of course, the more complex the object’s
      geometry, the harder it is to analyze the drag forces on it. Other factors such as surface
      condition, and whether or not the object is at the interface between two fluids (such as a
      ship in the ocean) further complicate the analysis. In practice, scale model tests are
      particularly useful. In the <a class="link" href="apd.html" title="Appendix D. Bibliography">Bibliography</a>, we give several
      sources where you can find more practical drag data for objects other than <a id="I_indexterm6_id318868" class="indexterm"/>spheres.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Magnus Effect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="magnus_effect">Magnus Effect</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Magnus effect</em></span> (also known as the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>Robbins effect</em></span>) is<a id="pr6.3" class="indexterm"/><a id="ro6.3" class="indexterm"/><a id="ma6.3" class="indexterm"/> quite an interesting phenomenon. You know from the previous
    section that an object moving through a fluid encounters drag. What would
    happen if that object were now spinning as it moved through the fluid? For
    example, consider the <a id="I_indexterm6_id318935" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id318945" class="indexterm"/>sphere that we talked about earlier and assume that while
    moving through a fluid such as air or water, it spins about an axis
    passing through its center of mass. What happens when the sphere spins is
    the interesting part—it actually generates lift! That’s right,
    <span class="emphasis"><em>lift</em></span>. <a id="li6.3" class="indexterm"/>From everyday experience, most people usually associate lift
    with a wing-like shape such as an airplane wing or a hydrofoil. It is far
    less well known that cylinders and spheres can produce lift as well—that
    is, as long as they are spinning. We’ll use the moving sphere to explain
    what’s happening here.</p><p>From the previous section on drag, you know that for a fast-moving
    sphere there will be some point on the sphere where the flow separates,
    creating a turbulent wake behind the sphere. Recall that the pressure
    acting on the sphere within this turbulent wake is lower than the pressure
    acting on the leading surface of the sphere, and this pressure
    differential gives rise to the pressure drag component. When the sphere is
    spinning—say, clockwise—about a horizontal axis passing through its
    center, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#spinning_sphere" title="Figure 6-12. Spinning sphere">Figure 6-12</a>, the fluid passing
    over the top of the sphere will be sped up while the fluid passing under
    the sphere will be retarded.</p><div class="figure"><a id="spinning_sphere"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject6_id319007"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598924.png" alt="Spinning sphere"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 6-12. Spinning sphere</div></div><p>Remember, because of friction, there is a thin boundary layer of
    fluid that attaches to the sphere’s surface. At the sphere’s surface, the
    velocity of the fluid in the boundary layer is 0 relative to the sphere.
    The velocity increases within the boundary layer as you move further away
    from the sphere’s surface. In the case of the spinning sphere, there is
    now a difference in fluid pressure above and below the sphere due to the
    increase in velocity above the sphere and the decrease in velocity below
    the sphere. Further, the separation point on the top side of the sphere
    will be pushed further back along the sphere. The end result is an
    asymmetric flow pattern around the sphere with a net lift force (due to
    the pressure differential) perpendicular to the direction of flow. If the
    surface of the sphere is roughened a little, not only will frictional drag
    increase, but this lift effect will increase as well.</p><p>Don’t let the term <span class="emphasis"><em>lift</em></span> confuse you into
    thinking that this force always acts to lift, or elevate, the sphere. The
    effect of this lift force on the sphere’s trajectory is very much tied to
    the axis of rotation about which the sphere is spinning as related to the
    direction in which the sphere is traveling (that is, its angular
    velocity).</p><p>The magnitude of the Magnus force is proportional to the speed of travel, rate of spin,
      density of fluid, size of the object, and nature of the fluid flow. This force is not easy to
      calculate analytically, and as with many problems in fluid dynamics, you must rely on
      experimental data to accurately estimate it for a specific object under specific conditions.
      There are, however, some analytical techniques that will allow you to approximate the Magnus
      force. Without going into the theoretical details, you can apply the <span class="emphasis"><em>Kutta-Joukouski
        theroem</em></span> to estimate the lift force on rotating objects such as cylinders and
      spheres. The Kutta-Joukouski theorem is <a id="I_indexterm6_id319058" class="indexterm"/>based on a frictionless idealization of fluid flow involving the concept of
      circulation around the object (like a vortex around the object). You can find the details of
      this theory in any fluid dynamics text (we give some references in the <a class="link" href="apd.html" title="Appendix D. Bibliography">Bibliography</a>), so we won’t go into the details here. However,
      we will give you some results.</p><p>For a spinning circular cylinder moving through a fluid, you can use
    this formula to estimate the Magnus lift force:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F<sub>L</sub> = 2 π ρ L v
      r<sup>2</sup> ω</td></tr></table><p>where <span class="emphasis"><em>v</em></span> is the speed of travel,
    <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span> is the length of the cylinder,
    <span class="emphasis"><em>r</em></span> is its radius, and ω is its angular velocity in
    radians per second (rad/s). If you have spin, <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>, in
    revolutions per second (rps), then ω = 2 π <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>. If you
    have spin, <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>, in revolutions per minute (rpm), then ω
    = (2 π <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>) / 60.</p><p>For a spinning sphere moving through a fluid, you can use this
    formula:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F<sub>L</sub> = (2 π ρ v
      r<sup>4</sup> ω) / (2 r)</td></tr></table><p>where <span class="emphasis"><em>r</em></span> is the radius of the sphere. Consistent
    units for these equations would yield lift force in pounds in the English
    system or newtons in the SI system. In the SI system, the appropriate
    units for these quantities are kg/m<sup>3</sup>, m/s, and
    m, respectively.</p><p>Keep in mind that these formulas only approximate the Magnus force;
    they’ll get you in the ballpark, but they are not exact and actually could
    be off by up to 50% depending on the situation. These formulas assume that
    1) there is no slip between the fluid and the rotating surface of the
    object, 2) there is no friction, 3) surface roughness is not taken into
    account, and 4) there is no boundary layer.</p><p>At any rate, these equations will allow you to approximate the
    Magnus effect for flying objects in your games, where you’ll be able to
    model the relative differences between objects of different size that may
    be traveling at different speeds with different spin rates. You’ll get the
    look right. If numerical accuracy is what you’re looking for, then you’ll
    have to turn to experimental data for your <a id="I_indexterm6_id319174" class="indexterm"/>specific problem.</p><p>Similar to the drag data shown in the previous section, experimental
    lift data is generally presented in terms of lift coefficient. Using an
    equation similar to the drag equation, you can calculate the <a id="I_indexterm6_id319190" class="indexterm"/>lift force with the following equation:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F<sub>L</sub> = (0.5 ρ v<sup>2</sup>
      A) C<sub>L</sub></td></tr></table><p>As usual, it’s not as simple as this equation makes it appear. The
    trick is in determining the lift coefficient, C<sub>L</sub>,
    which is a function of surface conditions, the Reynolds number, velocity,
    and spin rate. Further, experiments show that the drag coefficient is also
    affected by spin.</p><p>For example, consider a <a id="I_indexterm6_id319234" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id319244" class="indexterm"/>golf ball struck perfectly (right!) such that the ball spins
    about a horizontal axis perpendicular to its direction of travel while in
    flight. In this case the Magnus force will tend to lift the ball higher in
    the air, increasing its flight time and range. For a golf ball struck such
    that its initial velocity is 58 m/s with a take-off angle of 10 degrees,
    the increase in range due to Magnus lift is on the order of 59 meters;
    thus, it’s clear that this effect is significant. In fact, over the long
    history of the game of golf, people have attempted to maximize this
    effect. In the late 1800s, when golf balls were still made with smooth
    surfaces, players observed that used balls with roughened surfaces flew
    even better than smooth balls. This observation prompted manufacturers to
    start making balls with rough surfaces so as to maximize the Magnus lift
    effect. The dimples that you see on modern golf balls are the result of
    many decades of experience and research and are thought to be
    optimum.</p><p>Typically a golf ball takes off from the club with an initial
    velocity on the order of 76 m/s, with a backspin on the order of 60
    revolutions per second (rps). For these initial conditions, the
    corresponding Magnus lift coefficient is within the range of 0.1 to 0.35.
    Depending on the spin rate, this lift coefficient can be as high as 0.45,
    and the lift force acting on the ball can be as much as 50% of the ball’s
    weight.</p><p>If the golf ball is struck with a less-than-perfect stroke (that’s
    more like it), the Magnus lift force may work against you. For example, if
    your swing is such that the ball leaves the club head spinning about an
    axis that is not horizontal, then the ball’s trajectory will curve,
    resulting in a slice or a draw. If you top the ball such that the upper
    surface of the ball is spinning away from you, then the ball will tend to
    curve downward much more rapidly, significantly reducing the range of your
    shot.</p><p>As another example, consider a <a id="I_indexterm6_id319283" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm6_id319293" class="indexterm"/>baseball pitched such that it’s spinning with topspin about
    a horizontal axis perpendicular to its direction of travel. Here the
    Magnus force will tend to cause the ball to curve in a downward direction,
    making it drop more rapidly than it otherwise would without spin. If the
    pitcher spins the ball such that the axis of rotation is not horizontal,
    then the ball will curve out of the vertical plane. Another trick that
    pitchers use is to give the ball backspin, making it appear (to the
    batter) to actually rise. This rising fastball does not
    <span class="emphasis"><em>actually</em></span> rise, but because of the Magnus lift force
    it falls much less rapidly than it would without spin.</p><p>For a typical pitched speed and spin rate of 45 m/s and 30 rps,
    respectively, the lift force can be up to 33% of the ball’s weight. For a
    typical curveball, the lift coefficient is within the range of 0.1 to 0.2,
    and for flyballs it can be up to 0.4.</p><p>These are only two examples; however, you need not look far to find
    other examples of the Magnus force in action. Think about the behavior of
    cricket balls, soccer balls, tennis balls, or ping-pong balls when they
    spin in flight. Bullets fired from a gun with a rifling barrel also spin
    and are affected by this Magnus force. There have even been sailboats
    built with tall, vertical, rotating cylindrical “sails” that use the
    Magnus force for propulsion. We’ve also seen technical articles describing
    a propeller with spinning cylindrical blades instead of airfoil-type
    blades.</p><p>To further illustrate the Magnus effect, we’ve prepared a simple
    example program that simulates a ball being thrown with varying amounts of
    backspin (or topspin). This example is based on the cannon example, so
    here again, the code should look familiar to you. In this example we’ve
    neglected drag, so the only forces that the ball will see are due to
    gravity and the Magnus effect. We did this to isolate the lift-generating
    effect of spin and to keep the equations of motion clearer.</p><p>Since most of the code for this example is identical, or very
    similar, to the previous cannon examples, we won’t repeat it here. We
    will, however, show you the global variables used in this simulation along
    with a revised <code class="literal">DoSimulation</code> function

    The equations of motion here come from the 2D kinetic equations of motion
    including gravity, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Kinetics">Chapter 4</a>, combined
    with the following formula (shown earlier) for estimating the Magnus lift
    on a spinning sphere:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F<sub>L</sub> = (2 π<sup>2</sup> ρ v
      r<sup>4</sup> ω) / (2 r)</td></tr></table><p>You can see the effect of spin on the projectile’s trajectory by
    providing the sample program with different values for spin in revolutions
    per minute. The program converts this to radians per second and stores
    this value in the variable <code class="literal">omega</code>. A
    positive spin value indicates bottom spin such that the bottom of the
    sphere is spinning away from you, while a negative spin indicates topspin,
    where the top of the ball spins away from you. Bottom spin generates a
    positive lift force that will tend to extend the range of the projectile,
    while topspin generates negative lift that will force the projectile
    toward the ground, shortening its range. (Note that this example assumes
    that the spin axis is horizontal and perpendicular to the plane of the

    mass. We’ll look at variable mass here since it applies to self-propelled
    projectiles such as rockets. When a rocket is producing thrust to
    accelerate, it loses mass (fuel) at some rate. When all of the fuel is
    consumed (burnout), the rocket no longer produces thrust and has reached
    its maximum speed. After burnout you can treat the trajectory of the
    rocket just as you would a non-self-propelled projectile, as discussed
    earlier. However, while the rocket is producing thrust, you need to
    consider its mass change since this will affect its motion.</p><p>In cases where the mass change of the object under consideration is
    such that the mass being expelled or taken in has 0 absolute velocity—like
    a ship consuming fuel, for example—you can set up the equations of motion
    as you normally would, where the sum of the forces equals the rate of
    change in momentum. However, in this case mass will be a function of time,
    and your equations of motion will look like this:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>ΣF = m a = d/dt (m v) =m (dv/dt) + (dm/dt) v</td></tr></table><p>You can proceed to solve them just as you would normally, but keep
    in mind the time dependence of mass.</p><p>A rocket, on the other hand, expels mass at some nonzero velocity,
    and you can’t use the preceding approach to properly account for its mass
    change. In this case, you need to consider the relative velocity between
    the expelled mass and the rocket itself. The linear equation of motion now
    looks like this:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>ΣF = m dv/dt + dm/dt u</td></tr></table><p>where <span class="emphasis"><em>u</em></span> is the relative velocity between the
    expelled mass and the object (the rocket in this case).</p><p>For a rocket traveling straight up, neglecting air resistance and
    the pressure at the exhaust nozzle, the only force acting on the rocket is
    due to gravity. But the rocket is expelling mass (burning fuel). How it
    expels this mass is not important here, since the forces involved are
    internal to the rocket; we need to consider only the external forces. Let
    the fuel burn rate be <span class="emphasis"><em>–m’</em></span>. The equation of motion (in
    the vertical direction) for the rocket is as follows:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>ΣF = m dv/dt + dm/dt u</td></tr><tr><td>−mg = m dv/dt − m’ u</td></tr></table><p>If you rearrange this so that it looks like there’s only an
    <span class="emphasis"><em>ma</em></span> term on the right of this equation, you
    get:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>m’ u − mg = m dv/dt = ma</td></tr></table><p>Here you can see that the thrust that propels the rocket into the
