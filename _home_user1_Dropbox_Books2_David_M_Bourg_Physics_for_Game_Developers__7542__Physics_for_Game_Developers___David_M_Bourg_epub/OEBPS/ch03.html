    kinetics. The aim here is to provide you with enough of a background on forces so you can
    readily appreciate the subject of kinetics. This chapter is not meant to be the final word on
    the subject of force. In fact, we feel that the subject of force is so important to realistic
    simulations that we’ll revisit it several times in various contexts throughout the remainder of
    this book. In this chapter, we’ll discuss the two fundamental categories of force and briefly
    explain some important specific types of force. We’ll also explain the relationship between
    force and torque.</p><div class="sect1" title="Forces"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="forces">Forces</h2></div></div></div><p>As we mentioned in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Kinematics">Chapter 2</a>, you need to <a id="I_indexterm3_id303234" class="indexterm"/>understand the concept of force before you can fully understand the subject of
      kinetics. Kinematics is only half the battle. You are already familiar with the concept of
      force from your daily experiences. You exert a force on this book as you hold it in your
      hands, counteracting gravity. You exert force on your mouse as you move it from one point to
      another. When you play soccer, you exert force on the ball as you kick it. In general, force
      is what makes an object move, or more precisely, what produces an acceleration that changes
      the velocity. Even as you hold this book, although it may not be moving, you’ve effectively
      produced an acceleration that cancels the acceleration from gravity. When you kick that soccer
      ball, you change its velocity from, say, 0 when the ball is at rest to some positive value as
      the ball leaves your foot. These are some examples of externally <a id="I_indexterm3_id303254" class="indexterm"/>applied <span class="emphasis"><em>contact</em></span> forces.</p><p>There’s another broad category of forces, in addition to contact forces, <a id="I_indexterm3_id303272" class="indexterm"/>called <span class="emphasis"><em>field</em></span> forces or <a id="I_indexterm3_id303286" class="indexterm"/>sometimes <span class="emphasis"><em>forces at a distance</em></span>. These forces can act on a
      body without actually having to make contact with it. A good example is the gravitational
      attraction between objects. Another example is the electromagnetic attraction between charged
      particles. The concept of a force field was developed long ago to help us visualize the
      interaction between objects subject to forces at a distance. You can say that an object is
      subjected to the gravitational field of another object. Thinking in terms of force fields can
      help you grasp the fact that an object can exert a force on another object without having to
      physically touch it.</p><p>Within these two broad categories of forces, there are specific types of forces related to
      various physical phenomena—forces due to friction, buoyancy, and pressure, among others. We’ll
      discuss idealizations of several of these types of forces in this chapter. Later in this book,
      we’ll revisit these forces from a more practical point of view.</p><p>Before going further, we need to explain the implications of Newton’s <a id="I_indexterm3_id303313" class="indexterm"/>third law as introduced in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Basic Concepts">Chapter 1</a>. Remember, Newton’s
      third law states that for every force acting on a body, there is an equal and opposite
      reacting force. This means that forces must exist in pairs—a single force can’t exist by
      itself.</p><p>Consider the gravitational attraction between the earth and yourself. The earth is
      exerting a force—your weight—on you, accelerating you toward its center. Likewise, you are
      exerting a force on the earth, accelerating it toward you. The huge difference between your
      mass and the earth’s makes the acceleration of the earth in this case so small that it’s
      negligible. Earlier we said you are exerting a force on this book to hold it up; likewise,
      this book is exerting a force on your hands equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to
      the force you are exerting on it. You feel this reaction force as the book’s weight.</p><p>This phenomenon of action-reaction is the basis for rocket propulsion. A rocket engine
      exerts force on the fuel molecules that are accelerated out of the engine exhaust nozzle. The
      force required to accelerate these molecules is exerted back against the rocket as a reaction
      force <a id="I_indexterm3_id303347" class="indexterm"/>called <span class="emphasis"><em>thrust</em></span>. Throughout the remainder of this book, you’ll
      see many other examples of action-reaction, which is an important phenomenon in rigid-body
      dynamics. It is especially important when we are dealing with collisions and objects in
      contact, as you’ll see later.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Force Fields"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="force_fields">Force Fields</h2></div></div></div><p>The best example of a <a id="I_indexterm3_id303377" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id303388" class="indexterm"/>force field or force at a distance is the gravitational attraction between
      objects. <span class="emphasis"><em>Newton’s law of gravitation</em></span>
      <a id="I_indexterm3_id303399" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id303409" class="indexterm"/>states that the force of attraction between two masses is directly proportional to
      the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distances separating
      the centers of each mass. Further, this law states that the line of action of the force of
      attraction is along the line that connects the centers of the two masses. This is written as
      follows:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F<sub>a</sub> = (G m<sub>1</sub> m<sub>2</sub>) /

      example, at sea level. In reality, <span class="emphasis"><em>g</em></span> varies with <a id="I_indexterm3_id303520" class="indexterm"/>altitude—maybe not by much for our purposes, but it does. Consider Newton’s second
      law along with the <a id="I_indexterm3_id303533" class="indexterm"/>law of gravitation for a body near the earth. Equating these two laws, in equation
      form, yields:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>m a = (G M<sub>e</sub> m) / (R<sub>e</sub> +

      Thus, friction is a <a id="co3.3" class="indexterm"/>contact force. Friction is always parallel to the contacting surfaces at the point
      of contact—that is, friction is tangential to the contacting surfaces. The magnitude of the
      frictional force is a function of the normal force between the contacting surfaces and the
      surface roughness.</p><p>This is easiest to visualize by looking at a simple block on a horizontal surface, as

In fact, a major component of fluid
      dynamic drag is friction that results from the relative flow of the fluid over (and in contact
      with) the body’s surface. Friction is not the only component of fluid dynamic drag, though.
      Depending on the shape of the body, its speed, and the nature of the fluid, fluid dynamic drag
      will have additional components due to pressure variations in the fluid as it flows around the
      body. If the body is located at the interface between two fluids (like a ship on the ocean
      where the two fluids are air and water), an additional component of drag will exist due to the
      wave generation.</p><p>In general, fluid dynamic drag is a complicated phenomenon that is a function of several
      factors. We won’t go into detail in this section on all these factors, since we’ll revisit
      this subject later. However, we do want to discuss how <a id="I_indexterm3_id304552" class="indexterm"/>the <span class="emphasis"><em>viscous</em></span> (frictional) component of these drag forces is

      account the surface conditions of the body, the fluid properties (density and viscosity), and
      the flow conditions. You’ll typically see a formula for viscous drag force in the form:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F<sub>v</sub> = –C<sub>f</sub> v</td></tr></table><p>where <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>f</sub> is the drag coefficient,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>v</em></span> is the body’s speed, and the minus sign means that the force opposes

      Note that the values of <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>f</sub> are generally not the

        <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>f</sub> depends significantly on whether the flow is
      laminar or turbulent.</p><p>Both of these equations are very simplified and inadequate for practical analysis of fluid
      flow problems. However, they do offer certain advantages in computer game simulations. Most
      obviously, these formulas are easy to implement—you need only know the velocity of the body
      under consideration, which you get from your kinematic equations, and an assumed value for the
      drag coefficient. This is convenient, as your game world will typically have many different
      types of objects of all sizes and shapes that would make rigorous analysis of each of their
      drag properties impractical. If the illusion of realism is all you need, not real-life
      accuracy, then these formulas may be sufficient.</p><p>Another advantage of using these idealized formulas is that you can tweak the drag
      coefficients as you see fit to help reduce numerical instabilities when solving the equations
      of motion, while maintaining the illusion of realistic behavior. If real-life accuracy is what
      you’re going for, then you’ll have no choice but to consider a more involved (read:
      complicated) approach for determining fluid dynamic drag. We’ll talk more about drag in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Projectiles">Chapter 6</a> through <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Implementing Collision Response">Chapter 10</a>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Pressure"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="pressure">Pressure</h2></div></div></div><p>Many people confuse <a id="I_indexterm3_id304761" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id304771" class="indexterm"/>pressure with force. You have probably heard people say, when explaining a
      phenomenon, something like, “It pushed with a force of 100 pounds per square inch.” While you
      understand what they mean, they are technically referring to pressure, not force. Pressure is
      force per unit area, thus the <a id="I_indexterm3_id304785" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id304797" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id304804" class="indexterm"/>units <span class="emphasis"><em>pounds per square inch</em></span> (psi) or <span class="emphasis"><em>pounds per

      pressure in order to determine the resultant force. Force equals pressure times area:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F = PA</td></tr></table><p>This formula tells you that for constant pressure, the greater the area acted upon, the
      greater the resultant force. If you rearrange this equation solving for pressure, you’ll see
      that pressure is inversely proportional to area—that is, the greater the area for a given
      applied force, the smaller the resulting pressure and vice versa.</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>P = F/A</td></tr></table><p>An important characteristic of pressure is that it always acts normally (perpendicularly)
      to the surface of the body or object it is acting on. This fact gives you a clue as to the
      direction of the resultant force vector.</p><p>We wanted to mention pressure here because you’ll be working with it to calculate forces
      when you get to the chapters in this book that cover the mechanics of ships, boats, and

      buoyancy next.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Buoyancy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="buoyancy">Buoyancy</h2></div></div></div><p>You’ve no doubt felt the <a id="fo3.6" class="indexterm"/><a id="bu3.6" class="indexterm"/>effects of buoyancy when immersing yourself in the bathtub. Buoyancy is why you
      feel lighter in water than you do in air and why some people can float on their backs in a
      swimming pool.</p><p>Buoyancy is a force that develops when an object is immersed in a fluid. It’s a function
      of the volume of the object and the density of the fluid and results from the pressure
      differential between the fluid just above the object and the fluid just below the object.
      Pressure <a id="I_indexterm3_id304939" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id304949" class="indexterm"/>increases the deeper you go in a fluid, thus the pressure is greater at the bottom
      of an object of a given height than it is at the top of the object. Consider the cube shown in

      equal. Further, let <span class="emphasis"><em>h</em></span><sub>t</sub> denote the depth to the top
      of the cube and <span class="emphasis"><em>h</em></span><sub>b</sub> the depth to the bottom of the
      cube. The pressure at the top of the cube is <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span><sub>t</sub>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>=</em></span> ρ <span class="emphasis"><em>g h</em></span><sub>t</sub>, which acts over the
      entire surface area of the top of the cube, normal to the surface in the downward direction.

      Note that the pressure acting on the sides of the cube increases linearly with submergence,
      from <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span><sub>t</sub> to
        <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span><sub>b</sub>. Also, note that since the side pressure is
      symmetric, equal and opposite, the net side pressure is 0, which means that the net side force
      (due to pressure) is also 0. The same is not true of the top and bottom pressures, which are
      obviously not equal, although they are opposite.</p><p>The force acting down on the top of the cube is equal to the pressure at the top of the
      cube times the surface area of the top. This can be written as follows:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F<sub>t</sub> = P<sub>t</sub>
        A<sub>t</sub></td></tr><tr><td>F<sub>t</sub> = (ρ g h<sub>t</sub>)
          (s<sup>2</sup>)</td></tr></table><p>Similarly, the force acting upward on the bottom of the cube is equal to the pressure at
      the bottom times the surface area of the bottom.</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F<sub>b</sub> = P<sub>b</sub>
        A<sub>b</sub></td></tr><tr><td>F<sub>b</sub> = (ρ g h<sub>b</sub>)

          (h<sub>b</sub> – h<sub>t</sub>)</td></tr></table><p>This formula gives the magnitude of the buoyancy force. Its direction is straight up,
      counteracting the weight of the object.</p><p>There is an important observation we need to make here. Notice that
        (<span class="emphasis"><em>h</em></span><sub>b</sub>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>– h</em></span><sub>t</sub>) is simply the height of the cube, which is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>s</em></span> in this case. Substituting <span class="emphasis"><em>s</em></span> in place of
        (<span class="emphasis"><em>h</em></span><sub>b</sub>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>– h</em></span><sub>t</sub>) reveals that the buoyancy force is a
      function of the volume of the cube.</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F<sub>B</sub> = (ρ g) (s<sup>3</sup>)</td></tr></table><p>This is great since it means that all you need to do in order to calculate <a id="I_indexterm3_id305275" class="indexterm"/>buoyancy is to first calculate the volume of the object and then multiply that
      volume by the specific <a id="I_indexterm3_id305287" class="indexterm"/>weight<sup>[<a id="CHP-3-FN-3" href="#ftn.CHP-3-FN-3" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">11</a>]</sup> (ρ <span class="emphasis"><em>g</em></span>) of the fluid. In truth, that’s a little easier said
      than done for all but the simplest geometries. If you’re dealing with spheres, cubes,
      cylinders, and the like, then calculating volume is easy. However, if you’re dealing with any
      arbitrary geometry, then the volume calculation becomes more difficult. There are two ways to
      handle this difficulty. The first way is to simply divide the object into a number of smaller
      objects of simpler geometry, calculate their volumes, and then add them all up. The second way
      is to use numerical integration techniques to calculate volume by integrating over the surface
      of the object.</p><p>You should also note that buoyancy is a function of fluid density, and you don’t have to
      be in a fluid as dense as water to experience the force of buoyancy. In fact, there are
      buoyant forces acting on you right now, although they are very small, due to the fact that you
      are immersed in air. Water is many times more dense than air, which is why you notice the
      force of buoyancy when in water and not in air. Keep in mind, though, that for very light
      objects with relatively large volumes, the buoyant forces in air may be significant. For
      example, consider simulating a large <a id="I_indexterm3_id305332" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id305341" class="indexterm"/>balloon.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Springs and Dampers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="springs_and_dampers">Springs and Dampers</h2></div></div></div><p>Springs are <a id="I_indexterm3_id305365" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id305375" class="indexterm"/>structural elements that, when connected between two objects, apply equal and

      objects that are moving toward or away from each other, the damper acts to slow the relative
      velocity between the two objects. The force developed by a damper is proportional to the
      relative velocity of the connected objects and a damping constant,

      Specifically, to calculate the <a id="I_indexterm3_id305946" class="indexterm"/>torque applied by a force acting on an object, you need to calculate the
      perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force and then
      multiply this distance by the magnitude of the force.</p><p>This calculation gives the magnitude of the torque. Typical units for force are pounds,
      newtons, and tons. Since torque is force times a distance, its units take the form of a length
      unit times a force unit (e.g., foot-pounds, newton-meters, or foot-tons).</p><p>Since both force and torque are vector quantities, you must also determine the direction
      of the torque vector. The force vector is easy to visualize: its line of action passes through
      the point of application of the force, with its direction determined by the direction in which
      the force is applied. As a vector, the torque’s line of action is along the axis of rotation,
      with the direction determined by the <a id="I_indexterm3_id305973" class="indexterm"/>direction of rotation and <a id="I_indexterm3_id305986" class="indexterm"/>the <span class="emphasis"><em>right hand rule</em></span> (see <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#force_and_torque-id1" title="Figure 3-3. Force and torque">Figure 3-3</a>).

        + (0.525 ft) <span class="strong"><strong>j</strong></span> + (0) <span class="strong"><strong>k</strong></span></td></tr></table><p>Now using the formula <span class="strong"><strong>M</strong></span> = <span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span> × <span class="strong"><strong>F</strong></span> (or the formulas for the components of
      the torque vector shown earlier), you can write:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td><span class="strong"><strong>M</strong></span> = [(0.66 ft) <span class="strong"><strong>i</strong></span>

      vector are 0; thus, the torque moment is pointing directly along the z-axis. The torque vector
      would be pointing out of the page of this book in this case.</p><p>In dynamics you need to consider the sum, or total, of all forces acting on an object
      separately from the sum of all torques acting on a body. When summing forces, you simply add,
      vectorally, all of the forces without regard to their point of application. However, when
      summing torques you must take into account the point of application of the forces to calculate
      the torques, as shown in the previous example. Then you can take the vector sum of all torques
      acting on the body.</p><p>When you are considering rigid bodies that are not physically constrained to rotate about
      a fixed axis, any force acting through <a id="I_indexterm3_id306615" class="indexterm"/>the body’s center of mass will not produce a torque on the body about its center
      of gravity. In this case, the axis of rotation passes through the center of mass of the body
      and the vector <span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span> would be 0 (all components 0). When a
      force acts through a point on the body some distance away from its center of mass, a torque on
      the body will develop, and the angular motion of the body will be affected. Generally, <a id="I_indexterm3_id306636" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id306646" class="indexterm"/>field forces, which are forces at a distance, are assumed to act through a body’s
      center of mass; thus, only the body’s linear motion will be affected unless the body is
      constrained to rotate about a fixed point. Other contact forces, however, generally do not act
      through a body’s center of mass (they could but aren’t necessarily assumed to) and tend to
      affect the body’s angular motion as well as its <a id="I_indexterm3_id306660" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id306668" class="indexterm"/>linear motion.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="summary">Summary</h2></div></div></div><p>As we said earlier, this chapter on forces is your bridge from kinematics to kinetics.
      Here you’ve looked at the major force categories—contact forces and force fields—and some
      important specific types of forces. This chapter was meant to give you enough theoretical
      background on forces so you can fully appreciate the subject of kinetics that’s covered in the
      next chapter. In <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Aircraft">Chapter 15</a> through <a class="xref" href="ch19.html" title="Chapter 19. Sports">Chapter 19</a>, you’ll revisit the subject of forces from a
      much more practical point of view when we investigate specific real-life problems. We’ll also
      introduce some new specific types of force in those chapters that we didn’t cover here.</p></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr style="width: 100; align: left;"/><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.CHP-3-FN-1"><p><sup>[<a href="#CHP-3-FN-1" class="para">9</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em>Static</em></span> here implies that there is no motion; the block is sitting
