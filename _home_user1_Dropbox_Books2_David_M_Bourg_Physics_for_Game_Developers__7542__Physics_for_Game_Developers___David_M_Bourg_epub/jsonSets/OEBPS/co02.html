     are a cat and a mouse. The age-old rivalry between cat and mouse has been the topic of many
    children’s books and Saturday cartoons. From traditional folk tales, such as Aesop’s fables and
    Grimm Brothers’ fairy tales, to today’s cartoons, such as  <span class="emphasis"><em>Tom &amp; Jerry</em></span>
    , the cat has chased and bullied the mouse and the mouse has avoided becoming lunch. The cat may
    be bigger and stronger, but the mouse is small, fast, and can fit in tight spaces, so the end
    result is often a battle of wits.  </p><p>The cover image is from a 19-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. The cover
