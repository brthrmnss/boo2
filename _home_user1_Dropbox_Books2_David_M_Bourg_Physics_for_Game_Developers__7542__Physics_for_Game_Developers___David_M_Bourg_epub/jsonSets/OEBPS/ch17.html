  essentially 2D manner. Unless they have jumped a ramp, both vehicles remain
  on the ground or water plane. In this chapter we’ll discuss the forces
  behind each vehicle’s method of travel and discuss how to accurately model
  them in your simulations.</p><div class="sect1" title="Cars"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="cars">Cars</h2></div></div></div><p>In the <a id="I_indexterm3_id343862" class="indexterm"/>following sections we want to discuss certain aspects of the
    physics behind automobile motion. Like the previous four chapters, the
    purpose of this chapter is to explain, by example, certain physical
    phenomena. We also want to give you a basic understanding of the mechanics
    involved in automobile motion in case you want to simulate one in your
    games. In keeping with the theme of this book, we’ll be talking about
    mechanics in the sense of rigid-body motion, and not in the sense of how
    an internal combustion engine works, or how power is transferred through
    the transmission system to the wheels, etc. Those are all internal to the
    car as a rigid body, and we’ll focus on the external forces. We will,
    however, discuss how the torque applied to the drive wheel is translated
    to a force that pushes the car along.</p><div class="sect2" title="Resistance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="resistance">Resistance</h3></div></div></div><p>Before we talk <a id="I_indexterm3_id343894" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id343904" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id343916" class="indexterm"/>about why cars move forward, let’s talk about what slows
      them down. When a car drives down a road, it experiences two main
      components of resistance that try to slow it down. The first <a id="I_indexterm3_id343931" class="indexterm"/>component is aerodynamic drag, and the second is called
      <span class="emphasis"><em>rolling resistance</em></span>. The total resistance felt by
      the car is the sum of these two components:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>total</sub> = R<sub>air</sub> +
        R<sub>rolling</sub></td></tr></table><p>The aerodynamic drag is primarily skin friction <a id="I_indexterm3_id343973" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id343985" class="indexterm"/>and pressure drag similar to that experienced by the
      projectiles discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Projectiles">Chapter 6</a>, and the planes
      and boats discussed in earlier chapters. Here again, you can use the
      familiar drag formula:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>air</sub> = (1/2) ρ
        V<sup>2</sup> S<sub>p</sub>
        C<sub>d</sub></td></tr></table><p>Here ρ (rho) is the mass density of air, <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> is
      the speed of the car, <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span><sub>p</sub> is
      the projected frontal area of the car normal to the direction of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span>, and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>d</sub> is the drag coefficient.
      <a id="I_indexterm3_id344047" class="indexterm"/>Typical ranges of drag coefficients for different types of
      vehicles are 0.29 to 0.4 for sports cars, 0.43 to 0.5 for pickup trucks,
      0.6 to 0.9 for tractor-trailers, and 0.4 to 0.5 for the average economy
      car. Drag coefficient is a function of the shape of the vehicle—that is,
      the degree of boxiness or streamline. Streamlined body styles have lower
      drag coefficients; for example, the Chevy Corvette has a low drag
      coefficient of 0.29, while the typical tractor-trailer without fairings
      has a high drag coefficient of up to 0.9. You can use these coefficients
      in your simulations to tune the behavior of different types and shapes
      of vehicles.</p><p>When a tire rolls on a road, it experiences <a id="I_indexterm3_id344066" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id344074" class="indexterm"/>rolling resistance, which tends to retard its motion.
      Rolling resistance is not frictional resistance, but instead has to do
      with the deformation of the tire while rolling. It’s a difficult
      quantity to calculate theoretically since it’s a function of a number of
      complicated factors—such as tire and road deformation, the pressure over
      the contact area of the tire, the elastic properties of the tire and
      road materials, the roughness of the tire and road surfaces, and tire
      pressure, to name a few—so instead you’ll have to rely on an empirical
      formula. The formula to use is as follows:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>rolling</sub> = C<sub>r</sub>
        w</td></tr></table><p>This gives you the rolling resistance per tire, where
      <span class="emphasis"><em>w</em></span> is the weight supported by the tire, <a id="I_indexterm3_id344117" class="indexterm"/>and <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>r</sub> is the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>coefficient of rolling resistance</em></span>.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>r</sub> is simply the ratio of
      the rolling resistance force to the weight supported by the tire.
      Luckily for you, tire manufacturers generally provide the coefficient of
      rolling resistance for their tires under design conditions. Typical car
      tires have a <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>r</sub> of about
      0.015, while truck tires fall within the range of 0.006 to 0.01. If you
      assume that a car has four identical tires, then you can estimate the
      total rolling resistance for the car by substituting the total car
      weight for <span class="emphasis"><em>w</em></span> in the preceding equation.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Power"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="power">Power</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that you know <a id="I_indexterm3_id344167" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id344177" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id344187" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id344193" class="indexterm"/>how to calculate the total resistance on your car, you can
      easily calculate the power required to overcome the resistance at a
      given speed. Power is a measure of the amount of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>work</em></span> done by a force, or torque, over time.
      Mechanical work done by a force is equal to the force times the distance
      an object moves under the action of that force. It’s expressed in units
      such as foot-pounds. Since power is a measure of work done over time,
      its units are, for example, foot-pounds per second. Usually power in the
      context of car engine output is expressed in units of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>horsepower</em></span>, where 1 horsepower equals 550
      ft-lbs/s.</p><p>To calculate the horsepower required to overcome total resistance
      at a given speed, you simply use this formula:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>P = (R<sub>total</sub> V) / 550</td></tr></table><p>Here <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> is power in units of horsepower, and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span><sub>total</sub> is the total
      resistance corresponding to the car’s speed, <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span>.
      Note, in this equation
      <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span><sub>total</sub> must be in pound
      units and <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> must be in units of feet per
      second.</p><p>Now this is not the engine output power required to reach the
      speed <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> for your car; rather, it is the required
      power delivered by the drive wheel to reach the speed
      <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span>. The installed engine power will be higher for
      several reasons. First, there will be mechanical losses associated with
      delivering the power from the engine through the transmission and drive
      train to the tire. The power will actually reach the tire in the form of
      torque, which given the radius of the tire will create a force
      <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span><sub>w</sub> that will overcome the
      total resistance. This force is calculated as follows:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F<sub>w</sub> =
        T<sub>w</sub>/r</td></tr></table><p>Here <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span><sub>w</sub> is the force delivered by the tire
        to the road to push the car along, <span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span><sub>w</sub> is the
        torque on the tire, and <span class="emphasis"><em>r</em></span> is the radius of the tire. The second reason
        the installed engine power will be greater is because some engine power will be transferred
        to other systems in the car. For example, power is required to charge the battery and to run
        the air conditioner.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Stopping Distance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="stopping_distance">Stopping Distance</h3></div></div></div><p>Under normal <a id="I_indexterm3_id344340" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id344351" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id344357" class="indexterm"/>conditions, stopping distance is a function of the braking system and how hard
        the driver applies the brakes: the harder the brakes are applied, the shorter the stopping
        distance. That’s not the case when the tires start to skid. Under skidding conditions,
        stopping distance is a function of the <a id="I_indexterm3_id344370" class="indexterm"/>frictional force that develops between the tires and the road, in addition to
        the inclination of the roadway. If the car is traveling uphill, the skidding distance will
        be shorter because gravity helps slow the car, while it will tend to accelerate the car and
        increase the skidding distance when the car is traveling downhill.</p><p>There’s a simple formula that considers these factors that you can
      use to calculate skidding distance:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>d<sub>s</sub> = V<sup>2</sup> /
        [2g ( µ cos φ + sin φ)]</td></tr></table><p>Here <span class="emphasis"><em>d</em></span><sub>s</sub> is the
      <a id="I_indexterm3_id344417" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id344427" class="indexterm"/>skidding distance, <span class="emphasis"><em>g</em></span> the acceleration
      due to gravity, µ the coefficient of friction between the tires and
      road, <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> the initial speed of the car, and φ the
      inclination of the roadway (where a positive angle means uphill and a
      negative angle means downhill). Note that this equation does not take
      into account any aerodynamic drag that will help slow the car
      down.</p><p>The coefficient of friction will vary depending on the condition
      of the tires and surface of the road, but for rubber on pavement the
      dynamic friction coefficient is typically around 0.4, while the static
      coefficient is around 0.55.</p><p>When calculating the actual frictional force between the tire and road, say in a
        real-time simulation, you’ll use the same formula that we showed you in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Force">Chapter 3</a>:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F<sub>f</sub> = µ W</td></tr></table><p>Here <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span><sub>f</sub> is the friction force applied to
        each tire, assuming it’s not rolling, and <span class="emphasis"><em>W</em></span> is the weight supported by
        each tire. If you assume that all tires are identical, then you can use the total weight of
        the car in the preceding formula to determine the total friction force applied to all
        tires.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Steering"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="steering">Steering</h3></div></div></div><p>When you turn the <a id="ca17.1.4" class="indexterm"/><a id="st17.1.4" class="indexterm"/>steering wheel of a car, the front wheels exert a side
      force such that the car starts to turn. In terms of <a id="I_indexterm3_id344537" class="indexterm"/>Euler angles, this would be yaw, although Euler angles
      aren’t usually used in discussions about turning cars. Even if the car’s
      speed is constant, it experiences acceleration due to the fact that its
      velocity vector has changed direction. Remember, acceleration is the
      time rate of change in velocity, which has both magnitude and
      direction.</p><p>For a car to maintain its curved path, there must <a id="I_indexterm3_id344557" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id344564" class="indexterm"/>be a <span class="emphasis"><em>centripetal</em></span> force (“center
      seeking” in Greek) that acts on the car. When riding in a turning car,
      you feel an <a id="I_indexterm3_id344579" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id344585" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id344595" class="indexterm"/>apparent <span class="emphasis"><em>centrifugal</em></span> acceleration, or
      force directed away from the center of the turn. This acceleration is
      really a result of <span class="emphasis"><em>inertia</em></span>, the tendency of your
      body and the car to continue on their original path, and is not a real
      force acting on the car or your body. The real force is the centripetal
      force, and without it your car would continue on its straight path and
      not along the curve.</p><p>One of the most important aspects of racing is taking turns as fast as possible but
        without losing control. The longer you can wait to decelerate for the turn, and the sooner
        you can start accelerating again, the higher your average speed will be. It is interesting
        to note that when people ride in racecars, what really surprises them isn’t the acceleration
        but the massive decelerations they can create through braking forces. A Formula One car
        regularly experiences decelerations of 4g, with 5–6g being the extreme value for certain
        race courses. Most road-legal sports cars can achieve about 1g of braking force. This allows
        the racecars to maintain speed until just entering the corner.</p><p>When you turn the steering wheel in a car, the tires produce a
      centripetal force toward the center of the curve via friction with the
      surface of the road. It follows that the maximum static frictional force
      between the tires and the road must exceed the required centripetal
      force. Mathematically, this takes on the following inequality:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>µ <sub>s</sub>N &gt;
        mv<sup>2</sup>/r</td></tr></table><p>Centripetal acceleration is the square of the tangential velocity,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>v</em></span>, divided by the radius of the turn,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>r</em></span>. This multiplied by mass of the vehicle,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>m</em></span>, gives the force required to make a turn. The
      available force is the static coefficient of friction times the normal
      force, <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span>. Rewriting this formula, we can develop a
      simplified maximum cornering speed as follows:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>v<sub>limit</sub> &lt;  <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="inleq_1701.png" alt=""/></span> </td></tr></table><p>If this speed is exceeded, the cornering force will exceed the
      static coefficient of friction and the tires will begin to slide. It may
      be tempting to replace the normal force, <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span>, with
      the weight of the vehicle (mass times gravity) and cancel out the mass
      of the car, but the normal force may not always be simplified as such,
      as we’ll discuss in a moment. Also, in real life, the weight of a
      vehicle is rarely evenly distributed among all four tires and is
      definitely not when the car is acceleration or decelerating. In general,
      acceleration causes a weight shift to the aft tires, and deceleration
      causes weight to shift to the forward tires. This is important because,
      depending on where the weight is, the front or back tires will tend to
      have less available friction. If one or the other sets of tires begins
      to slide, the car will either <a id="I_indexterm3_id344706" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id344712" class="indexterm"/>understeer or oversteer (see <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#understeer_on_right_comma_oversteer_on" title="Figure 17-1. Understeer on right, oversteer on left">Figure 17-1</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="understeer_on_right_comma_oversteer_on"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_id344735"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598977.png.jpg" alt="Understeer on right, oversteer on left"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 17-1. Understeer on right, oversteer on left</div></div><p>If the front wheels slide, the car understeers and the arc is
      larger than the driver intended. This is commonly caused by traveling
      too fast through a corner and trying to take the corner too tightly.
      However, if the driver breaks hard or even just lets off the gas, there
      will be a weight shift forward. This will keep the forward wheels from
      slipping but if too aggressive will cause the rear wheels to slip as
      weight is transferred away from them. This causes the car to turn more
      than the driver intended, and can even result in a spin. These two
      conditions limit the speed at which a car can complete a turn and also
      the amount of deceleration the car can handle once the turn is
      initiated.</p><p>To increase the limit speed,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>v</em></span><sub>limit</sub>, we must increase the
      normal force. We could do so by increasing the car’s mass, but this
      would have negative effects on the car’s ability to accelerate or
      decelerate. A better solution is the use of aerodynamic features to
      create what is called <span class="emphasis"><em>downforce</em></span>. You may have seen
      racecars or even street cars with large wing-like features called
      spoilers on their trunks. Formula 1 cars also have wing-like appendages
      on the front of the car. These are like the wings of an airplane but
      inverted so that instead of pulling the vehicle up, they actually push
      the vehicle down. These wings, therefore, increase the normal force, and
      their effects are proportional to speed so that more downforce is
      available at higher speeds...just when you need it. In fact, some very
      fast cars create so much downforce that if the road were inverted, the
      car would remain glued to the pavement and be able to drive
      upside-down.</p><p>The trade-off for this increased cornering limit speed is increased drag caused by the
        airfoils. This limits the top speed of the vehicle in areas of road that have no corners. It
        is good practice to allow users to select an angle of attack for their vehicle’s airfoils.
        This forces them to choose between the option of higher top speed with slower cornering or
        faster cornering with lower top speed.</p><p>You may notice that on some raceways, the corners are not flat.
      This is called <a id="I_indexterm3_id344794" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id344800" class="indexterm"/>roadway bank or <span class="emphasis"><em>superelevation</em></span>. In a
      corner where the car would normally skid, the superelevation helps keep
      the car in the turn because as the car is inclined, a force component
      develops that acts toward the center of curvature of the turn (see <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#superelevation" title="Figure 17-2. Superelevation">Figure 17-2</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="superelevation"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_id344830"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598978.png" alt="Superelevation"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 17-2. Superelevation</div></div><p>The following simple formula relates the superelevation angle of a
      roadway to the speed of the car and the coefficient of friction between
      the tires and road:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>tan φ =
        V<sub>t</sub><sup>2</sup>/(g r) –
        µ<sub>s</sub></td></tr></table><p>Here, φ is the superelevation angle (as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#superelevation" title="Figure 17-2. Superelevation">Figure 17-2</a>),
      <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span><sub>t</sub> is the tangential

      <span class="emphasis"><em>g</em></span> is the acceleration due to gravity,

      µ<sub>s</sub> is the static coefficient of friction between

      then you can calculate the speed at which the car will begin to slip out

Their
    appeal seems to stem from their futuristic aura, high speed, and
    levitating ability, which lets them go anywhere. In real life, hovercraft
    have been around since the 1950s and have been used in combat, search and
    rescue, cargo transport, ferrying, and recreational roles. They come in
    all shapes and sizes, but they all pretty much work the same, with the
    basic idea of getting the craft off the land or water to reduce its drag.
    In <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. 2D Rigid-Body Simulator">Chapter 9</a>, we touched on what forces
    you have to model when considering hovercraft, and now we’ll talk about
    them in more detail.</p><div class="sect2" title="How Hovercraft Work"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="how_hovercraft_work">How Hovercraft Work</h3></div></div></div><p>The first hovercraft designs pumped air through an annular nozzle around the periphery
        of the craft (see <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#hovercraft_configurations" title="Figure 17-3. Hovercraft configurations">Figure 17-3</a>). Large fans are used to feed
        the air through the nozzle under the craft. This jet of air creates a region of relatively
        high pressure over the area underneath the craft, which results in a net lifting force. The
        lifting force must equal the weight of the craft if it is to attain hovering flight. This
        sort of lifting is known as <span class="emphasis"><em>aerostatic</em></span> lift. The <a id="I_indexterm3_id345024" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id345031" class="indexterm"/>hover height is limited by the amount of <a id="I_indexterm3_id345042" class="indexterm"/>power available and the lifting fan’s ability to pump enough air through the
        nozzle: the higher the hover height, the greater the power demand.</p><div class="figure"><a id="hovercraft_configurations"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_id345066"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598979.png" alt="Hovercraft configurations"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 17-3. Hovercraft configurations</div></div><p>This approach proved impractical because hover heights were very
      limited and made the clearance between the hard structure of the craft
      and the ground (or water) too small to overcome all but the smallest
      obstacles. The solution to this problem was to fit a flexible
      <span class="emphasis"><em>skirt</em></span> around the craft to contain the air cushion
      in what’s called <a id="I_indexterm3_id345093" class="indexterm"/>the <span class="emphasis"><em>plenum chamber</em></span> (see <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#hovercraft_configurations" title="Figure 17-3. Hovercraft configurations">Figure 17-3</a>). This approach extended the
      clearance between the ground and the hard structure of the craft
      significantly even though the gap between the bottom of the skirt and
      the ground was very small. This is the basic configuration of most
      hovercraft in operation today, although there are all sorts of skirt
      designs. Some of these skirts are simple curtains, while others are
      sophisticated pressurized bag and finger arrangements. The end result is
      that hovercraft fitted with skirts can clear relatively large obstacles
      without damage to their hard structure, and the skirt simply distorts
      and conforms to the terrain over which the craft operates.</p><p>The actual calculation of the aerostatic lift force is fairly
      complicated because the pressure distribution within the air cushion is
      nonuniform and because you must also take into account the performance
      of the lift fan system. There are theories available to treat both the
      annular jet and plenum chamber configurations, but they are beyond the
      scope of this book. Besides, for a game simulation, what’s important is
      that you realize that the lift force must equal the weight of the craft
      in order for it to maintain equilibrium in hovering flight.</p><p>Ideally, the ability of a hovercraft to eliminate contact with the
      ground (or water) over which it operates means that it can travel
      relatively fast since it no longer experiences contact drag forces.
      Notice we said <span class="emphasis"><em>ideally</em></span>. In reality, hovercraft
      often pitch and roll, causing parts of the skirt to drag, and any
      obstacle that comes into contact with the skirt will cause more drag. At
      any rate, while eliminating ground contact is good for speed, it’s not
      so good for maneuverability.</p><p>Hovercraft are <a id="I_indexterm3_id345139" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id345152" class="indexterm"/>notoriously difficult to control since they glide across
      the ground. They tend to continue on their original trajectory even
      after you try to turn them. Currently, there are several means employed
      in various configurations for directional control. Some hovercraft use
      vertical tail rudders much like an airplane, while others actually
      vector their propulsion thrust. Still others use bow thrusters, which
      offer very good control. All of these means are fairly easy to model in
      a simulation; they are all simply forces acting on the craft at some
      distance from its center of gravity so as to create a yawing moment. The
      2D simulation that we walked you through in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. 2D Rigid-Body Simulator">Chapter 9</a> shows how to handle bow thrusters.
      You can handle vertical tail rudders as we showed you <a id="I_indexterm3_id345174" class="indexterm"/>in <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Aircraft">Chapter 15</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Resistance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="resistance-id1">Resistance</h3></div></div></div><p>Let’s take a <a id="ho17.2.2" class="indexterm"/><a id="re17.2.2" class="indexterm"/>look now at some of the <a id="dr17.2.2" class="indexterm"/>drag forces acting on a hovercraft during flight. To do
      this, we’ll handle operation over land separately from operation over
      water since there are some specific differences in the drag forces
      experienced by the hovercraft.</p><p>When a hovercraft is operating over smooth land, the total drag
      acting against the hovercraft is <a id="ae17.2.2" class="indexterm"/><a id="hoa17.2.2" class="indexterm"/>aerodynamic in nature. This assumes that drag induced by
      dragging the skirt or hitting obstacles is ignored. The three components
      of aerodynamic drag are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Skin friction and <a id="I_indexterm3_id345306" class="indexterm"/>viscous pressure drag on the body of the craft</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Induced drag<a id="I_indexterm3_id345328" class="indexterm"/> when the craft is pitched</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Momentum drag</p></li></ul></div><p>In equation form, the total drag is as follows:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>total</sub> =
        R<sub>viscous</sub> + R<sub>induced</sub> +
        R<sub>momentum</sub></td></tr></table><p>The first of these components, the viscous drag<a id="I_indexterm3_id345376" class="indexterm"/> on the body of the craft, is the same sort of drag
      experienced by projectiles flying through the air, as explained in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Projectiles">Chapter 6</a>. This drag is estimated using the
      by-now-familiar formula:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>viscous</sub> = (1/2) ρ
        V<sup>2</sup> S<sub>p</sub>
        C<sub>d</sub></td></tr></table><p>Here ρ is the mass density of air, <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> the
      speed of the hovercraft, <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span><sub>p</sub>
      the projected frontal area of the craft normal to the direction of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span>, and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>d</sub> the drag coefficient.
      <a id="I_indexterm3_id345438" class="indexterm"/>Typical values of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>d</sub> for craft in operation
      today range from 0.25 to 0.4.</p><p>The next drag component, the induced drag, is a result of the
      craft assuming a pitched attitude when moving. When the bow of the craft
      pitches up by an angle τ, there will be a component of the aerostatic
      lift vector that acts in a direction opposing <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span>.
      This component is approximately equal to the weight of the craft times
      the tangent of the pitch angle:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>induced</sub> ≈ W (tan τ)</td></tr></table><p>Finally, momentum drag<a id="I_indexterm3_id345482" class="indexterm"/> results from the destruction of horizontal momentum of air, relative to the
        craft entering the lift fan intake. This component is difficult to compute unless you know
        the properties of the entire lifting system such that the <a id="I_indexterm3_id345492" class="indexterm"/>mass flow rate of air into the fan is known. Given the mass flow rate,
          <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span><sub>momentum</sub> is equal to the mass flow rate times
        the velocity of the craft:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>momentum</sub> =
        (dm<sub>fan</sub>/dt) V</td></tr></table><p>Mass flow rate is expressed in units such as kg/s, which when
      multiplied by velocity in m/s yields <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span>.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. 2D Rigid-Body Simulator">Chapter 9</a> we mentioned that it
      is beneficial to have the center of this drag be behind the center of
      gravity. This gives directional stability, as the vessel will tend to
      try to point into the apparent wind. Consider if the vessel yaws some
      angle, the forward velocity is creating a wind that is now hitting the
      side of the hovercraft. If the center of effort of this force is forward
      of the center of gravity, it will want to yaw the vessel more,
      increasing the side force and causing even greater drag until the vessel
      spins 180 degrees! If the center of effort of the wind is aft of the
      center of gravity, the vessel will spin back into the wind. You don’t
      want the center of effort so far aft that it is too difficult to turn
      the vessel, but it is generally better to have the vessel naturally
      straighten out than to require constant steering input to maintain a
      steady course. This is also true of sailboats and is called
      <span class="emphasis"><em>weather helm</em></span>. <a id="I_indexterm3_id345551" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm3_id345558" class="indexterm"/>This also occurs in airplanes. The solution in airplanes
      is similar to that of hovercraft: to fit tail fins that move the center
      of the area aft, increasing its directional stability. If you choose to
      model damage in your simulation, the loss of a tail fin will cause the
      vessel to be very difficult to control.</p><p>In addition to these three drag components, hovercraft will
      experience other forms of resistance when operating over water. These
      additional components <a id="I_indexterm3_id345577" class="indexterm"/><a id="we17.2.2" class="indexterm"/>are <span class="emphasis"><em>wave</em></span> drag and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>wetted</em></span> drag. The equation for total drag can thus
      be revised for operation over water as follows:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>total</sub> =
        R<sub>viscous</sub> + R<sub>induced</sub> +
        R<sub>momentum</sub> + R<sub>wave</sub> +
        R<sub>wetted</sub></td></tr></table><p>When a hovercraft operates over water, its air cushion creates a
      depression in the water surface due to cushion pressure (see <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#hovercraft_over_water" title="Figure 17-4. Hovercraft over water">Figure 17-4</a>). At zero to low speeds, the weight
      of this displaced volume of water is equal to the weight of the craft,
      just as if the craft were floating in the water supported by buoyancy.
      As the craft starts to move forward, it tends to pitch up by the bow.
      When that happens, the surface of the water in the depressed region is
      approximately parallel to the bottom of the craft. As speed increases,
      the depression is reduced and the pitch angle tends to decrease.</p><div class="figure"><a id="hovercraft_over_water"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_id345660"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598980.png" alt="Hovercraft over water"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 17-4. Hovercraft over water</div></div><p>Wave drag is a result of this depression and is equal to the
      horizontal components of pressure forces acting on the water surface in
      the depressed region. As it turns out, for small pitch angles and at low
      speeds, wave drag is on the same order of magnitude as the induced
      drag:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>wave</sub> ≈ W (tan τ)</td></tr></table><p>Since wave drag is proportional to the size of the depression, it
      tends to be highest at low speeds and decreases at higher operational
      speeds. If you were to plot the wave drag curve as a function of speed
      for a typical hovercraft, you’d find that it is not a straight or even
      parabolic curve, but rather it has a hump in the curve at the lower
      speed range, as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#wave_drag" title="Figure 17-5. Wave drag">Figure 17-5</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="wave_drag"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject3_id345720"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598981.png" alt="Wave drag"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 17-5. Wave drag</div></div><p>There are several theoretical treatments of wave drag in the
      literature that aim to predict the speed at which this hump occurs along
      with its magnitude. These theories indicate that the hump depends on the
      planform geometry of the hovercraft, and it tends to occur at speeds in
      the range of <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="inleq_1702.png" alt=""/></span> to <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="inleq_1703.png" alt=""/></span>, where <span class="emphasis"><em>g</em></span> is the acceleration due to
      gravity and <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span> is the length of the air cushion. In
      practice, the characteristics of a particular hovercraft’s wave drag are
      usually best determined through scale model testing.</p><p>The so-called wetted drag is a function of several things:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The fact that parts of the hull and skirt tend to hit the
          water surface during flight</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The impact of spray on the hull and skirt</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The increase in weight as the hovercraft gets wet and
          sometimes takes on water</p></li></ul></div><p>Wetted drag is difficult to predict, and in practice model tests
      are relied on to determine its magnitude for a particular design. It’s
      important to note, however, that this tends to be a significant drag
      component, sometimes accounting for as much as 30% of the total

      transversely forward of the center of gravity. In reality, most
      hovercraft are steered by vectoring the thrust of the propulsion fan via
      rudders attached directly aft of the fans. This can be modeled by
      angling the propulsive thrust.</p><p>The most important characteristic to remember about steering
      hovercraft is that they will not turn like a car or boat. The
      hovercraft, because it has lower friction with its environment, will
      take longer to turn and tends to continue in the direction it was
      heading while rotating. Once rotated, the thrust acts along a new
      vector. One possible maneuver in a hovercraft is to quickly rotate the
      vessel and then shut down the propulsive thrust. This would allow you to
      travel in one direction and point in another for as long as your
      momentum carries you. This could be very useful in strafing enemies or
      just racking up style points.</p></div></div></section></body></html>
