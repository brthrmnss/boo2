  what happens when they run into each other. That’s what we’ll address in
  this chapter; specifically, we’ll show you how to handle particle and, more
  interestingly, rigid-body collision response.</p><p>Before moving forward, we need to make a distinction between collision
  <span class="emphasis"><em>detection</em></span> and collision <span class="emphasis"><em>response</em></span>.
  <a id="I_indexterm5_id310783" class="indexterm"/>Collision detection is a computational geometry problem
  involving the determination of whether and where two or more objects have
  collided. <a id="I_indexterm5_id310796" class="indexterm"/>Collision response is a kinetics problem involving the motion
  of two or more objects after they have collided. While the two problems are
  intimately related, we’ll focus solely on the problem of collision response
  in this chapter. Later, in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Real-Time Simulations">Chapter 7</a> through
  <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Connecting Objects">Chapter 13</a>, we’ll show you how to implement
  collision detection and response in various real-time simulations, which
  draw upon concepts presented in this chapter.</p><p>Our treatment of rigid-body collision response in this chapter is
  based on classical (Newtonian) impact principles. Here, colliding bodies are
  treated as rigid irrespective of their construction and material. As in
  earlier chapters, the rigid bodies discussed here do not change shape even
  upon impact. This, of course, is an idealization. You know from your
  everyday experience that when objects collide they dent, bend, compress, or
  crumple. For example, when a baseball strikes a bat, it may compress as much
  as three-quarters of an inch during the millisecond of impact.
  Notwithstanding this reality, we’ll rely on well-established analytical and
  empirical methods to approximate rigid-body collisions.</p><p>This classical approach is widely used in engineering machine design, analysis, and
    simulations; however, for <a id="I_indexterm5_id310834" class="indexterm"/>rigid-body simulations there is another class of methods, known <a id="I_indexterm5_id310845" class="indexterm"/>as <span class="emphasis"><em>penalty methods</em></span>, at your disposal.<sup>[<a id="CHP-5-FN-1" href="#ftn.CHP-5-FN-1" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">13</a>]</sup> In penalty methods, the force at impact is represented by a temporary spring that
    gets compressed between the objects at the point of impact. This spring compresses over a very
    short time and applies equal and opposite forces to the colliding bodies to simulate collision
    response. Proponents of this method say it has the advantage of ease of implementation. However,
    one of the difficulties encountered in its implementation is numerical instability. There are
    other arguments for and against the use of penalty methods, but we won’t get into the debate
    here. Instead, we’ve included several references in the <a class="link" href="apd.html" title="Appendix D. Bibliography">Bibliography</a> for you to review if you are so inclined. Other methods of modeling
    collisions exist as well. For example, nonlinear finite element simulations are commonly used to
    model collisions during product design, such as the impact of a cellphone with the ground. These
    methods can be quite accurate; however, they are too slow for real-time applications. Further,
    they are overkill for games.</p><div class="sect1" title="Impulse-Momentum Principle"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="impulse-momentum_principle">Impulse-Momentum Principle</h2></div></div></div><p>Impulse is defined <a id="I_indexterm5_id310906" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id310916" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id310922" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id310931" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id310941" class="indexterm"/>as a force that acts over a very short period of time. For
    example, the force exerted on a <a id="I_indexterm5_id310953" class="indexterm"/>bullet when fired from a gun is an impulse force. The
    collision forces between two colliding objects are impulse forces, as when
    you kick a football or hit a baseball with a bat.</p><p>More specifically, impulse is a vector quantity equal to the change in momentum. The
      so-called <span class="emphasis"><em>impulse-momentum principle</em></span> says that the change in moment is
      equal to the applied impulse. For problems involving constant <a id="I_indexterm5_id310974" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id310986" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id310998" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id311007" class="indexterm"/>mass and moment of inertia, you can write:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>Linear impulse = ȫ <sub>(t– to t+)</sub> <span class="strong"><strong>F</strong></span> dt = m (<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>+</sub> – <span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>–</sub>)</td></tr><tr><td>Angular impulse = ȫ <sub>(t– to t+)</sub> <span class="strong"><strong>M</strong></span> dt = <span class="strong"><strong>I</strong></span>

    just after impact. You can calculate the average impulse force and torque
    using the following equations:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td><span class="strong"><strong>F</strong></span> = m (<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>+</sub> – <span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>–</sub>) /

      (t<sub>+</sub> – t<sub>–</sub>)</td></tr></table><p>Consider this simple example: a 150 gram (0.15 kg) bullet is fired
    from a gun at a muzzle velocity of 756 m/s. The bullet takes 0.0008
    seconds to travel through the 610 mm (0.610 m) rifle barrel. Calculate the
    impulse and the average impulsive force exerted on the bullet. In this
    example, the bullet’s mass is a constant 150 grams and its initial
    velocity is 0, thus its initial momentum is 0. Immediately after the gun
    is fired, the bullet’s momentum is its mass times the muzzle velocity,
    which yields a momentum of 113.4 kg-m/s. The impulse is equal to the
    change in momentum, and is simply 113.4 kg-m/s. The average impulse force
    is equal to the impulse divided by the duration of application of the
    force, or in this case:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>Average impulse force = (113.4 kg-m/s) / (0.0008 s)</td></tr><tr><td>Average impulse force = 141,750 N</td></tr></table><p>This is a simple but important illustration of the concept of impulse, and you’ll use the
      same principle when dealing with rigid-body impacts. During impacts, the forces of impact are
      usually very high and the duration of impact is usually very short. When two objects collide,
      each applies an impulse force to the other; these forces are equal in magnitude but opposite
      in direction. In the gun example, the impulse applied to the bullet to set it in motion is
      also applied in the opposite direction to the gun, giving you a nice kick in the shoulder.

    <a id="I_indexterm5_id311374" class="indexterm"/>rigid bodies collide, momentum is conserved. This means that
    for bodies of constant mass, the sum of their masses times their
    respective velocities before the impact is equal to the sum of their
    masses times their respective velocities after the impact:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1–</sub> +

    refers to velocity, subscript 1 refers to body one, subscript 2 refers to
    body two, subscript – refers to the instant just prior to impact, and
    subscript + refers to the instant just after impact.</p><p>A crucial assumption of this method is that during the instant of
    impact the only force that matters is the impact force; all other forces
    are assumed negligible over that very short duration. Remember this
    assumption, because in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Implementing Collision Response">Chapter 10</a>
    we’ll rely on it when implementing collision response in an example 2D
    real-time simulation.</p><p>We’ve already stated that rigid bodies don’t change shape during
    impacts, and you know from your own experience that real objects do change
    shape during impacts. What’s happening in real life is <a id="I_indexterm5_id311454" class="indexterm"/>that <span class="emphasis"><em>kinetic energy</em></span> is being converted
    to<a id="I_indexterm5_id311468" class="indexterm"/> strain energy to cause the objects to deform. (See the
    sidebar <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic Energy">Kinetic Energy</a> for further details on this
    topic.) When the deformation in the objects is permanent, energy is lost
    and thus kinetic energy is not conserved.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="kinetic_energy"/><div class="sidebar-title">Kinetic Energy</div><p>Kinetic energy is a <a id="I_indexterm5_id311500" class="indexterm"/>form of energy associated with moving bodies. It is equal
      to the energy required to accelerate the body from rest, which is also
      equal to the energy required to bring the moving body to a stop. As you
      might expect, kinetic energy is a function of the body’s speed, or
      velocity, in addition to its mass. The formula for <a id="I_indexterm5_id311514" class="indexterm"/>linear kinetic energy is:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>KE<sub>linear</sub> = (1/2) m

    <span class="emphasis"><em>plastic</em></span>, collisions. For example, if you throw two
    clay balls against each other, their kinetic energy is converted to
    permanent strain energy in deforming the clay balls, and their collision
    response—that is, their motion after impact—is less than spectacular. If
    the collision is <span class="emphasis"><em>perfectly inelastic</em></span>, then the two
    balls of clay will stick to each other and move together at the same
    velocity after impact. Collisions where kinetic energy is conserved are
    called <span class="emphasis"><em>perfectly elastic</em></span>. In these collisions, the
    sum of kinetic energy of all objects before the impact is equal to the sum
    of kinetic energy of all objects after the impact. A good example of
    elastic impact (though not <span class="emphasis"><em>perfectly</em></span> elastic) is the
    collision between two billiard balls where the ball deformation is
    negligible and certainly not permanent under normal circumstances.</p><p>Of course, in reality, impacts are somewhere between perfectly
    elastic and perfectly inelastic. This means that for rigid bodies, which
    don’t change shape at all, we’ll have to rely on an empirical relation to
    quantify the degree of elasticity of the impact(s) that we’re trying to
    simulate. The relation that we’ll use is the ratio of the relative
    separation velocity to the relative approach velocity of the colliding
    objects:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>e = −(v<sub>1+</sub> − v<sub>2+</sub>) /

    restitution</em></span> and <a id="I_indexterm5_id311727" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id311737" class="indexterm"/>is a function of the colliding objects’ material,
    construction, and geometry. This coefficient can be experimentally
    determined for specific impact scenarios—for example, the collision
    between a baseball and bat, or a golf club and ball. For perfectly
    inelastic collisions, <span class="emphasis"><em>e</em></span> is 0, and for perfectly
    elastic collisions, <span class="emphasis"><em>e</em></span> is 1. For collisions that are
    neither perfectly inelastic nor perfectly elastic, <span class="emphasis"><em>e</em></span>
    can be any value between 0 and 1. In this regard, the velocities

    and that the baseball is traveling in the horizontal plane when it strikes
    the bat. The bat is of standard dimensions with a maximum diameter of 70
    mm and a weight of 1.02 kg. The ball is also of standard dimensions with a
    radius of 37 mm and a weight of 0.15 kg. The ball reaches a speed of 40
    m/s (90 mph) at the instant it strikes the bat, and the speed of the bat
    at the point of impact is 31 m/s (70 mph). For this collision, the
    coefficient of restitution is 0.46. In the millisecond of impact that
    occurs, the baseball compresses quite a bit; however, in this analysis
    assume that both the bat and the ball are rigid. Finally, assume that this
    impact is frictionless.</p><p>As in the previous example, the line of action of impact is along

    by hand using the principle of conservation of momentum and the
    coefficient of restitution. This approach will suffice if you’re writing
    games where the collision events are well defined and anticipated.
    However, if you’re writing a real-time simulation where objects,
    especially arbitrarily shaped rigid bodies, may or may not collide, then
    you’ll want to use a more general approach. This approach involves the use
    of formulas to calculate the actual impulse between colliding objects so
    that you can apply this impulse to each object, instantly changing its
    velocity. In this section, we’ll derive the equations for impulse, both
    linear and angular, and we’ll show you how to implement these equations in
    code in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Implementing Collision Response">Chapter 10</a>.</p><p>When you’re dealing with particles or spheres, the only impulse
    formula that you’ll need is that for linear impulse, which will allow you
    to calculate the new linear velocities of the objects after impact. So,
    the first formula that we’ll derive for you is that for linear impulse
    between two colliding objects, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#two_colliding_particles_open_parenthesis" title="Figure 5-4. Two colliding particles (or spheres)">Figure 5-4</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="two_colliding_particles_open_parenthesis"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_id313292"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598910.png" alt="Two colliding particles (or spheres)"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 5-4. Two colliding particles (or spheres)</div></div><p>For now, assume the collision is frictionless and the line of action
    of the impulse is along the line connecting the centers of mass of the two
    objects. This line is normal to the surfaces of both objects.</p><p>To derive the formula for linear impulse, you have to consider the
    formula from the definition of impulse along with the formula for
    coefficient of restitution. Here let <span class="emphasis"><em>J</em></span> represent the
    impulse:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>|<span class="strong"><strong>J</strong></span>| = m (|<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>+</sub>| − |<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>−</sub>|)</td></tr><tr><td>e = −(|<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1+</sub>| − |<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>2+</sub>|)/(|<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1−</sub>| − |<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>2−</sub>|)</td></tr></table><p>In these equations the velocities are those along the line of action
    of the impact, which in this case is a line connecting the centers of mass
    of the two objects. Since the same impulse applies to each object (just in
    opposite directions), you actually have three equations to deal
    with:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>|<span class="strong"><strong>J</strong></span>| =
      m<sub>1</sub> (|<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1+</sub>| − |<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1−</sub>|)</td></tr><tr><td>|<span class="strong"><strong>−J</strong></span>| =
      m<sub>2</sub> (|<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>2+</sub>| − |<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>2−</sub>|)</td></tr><tr><td>e = −(|<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1+</sub>|− |<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>2+</sub>|)/(|<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1−</sub>| − |<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>2-</sub>|)</td></tr></table><p>Notice we’ve assumed that <span class="emphasis"><em>J</em></span> acts positively on body 1 and its
      negation, <span class="emphasis"><em>–J</em></span>, acts on body 2. Also notice that there are three unknowns
      in these equations: the impulse and the velocities of both bodies after the impact. Since
      there are three equations and three unknowns, you can solve for each unknown by rearranging
      the two impulse equations and substituting them into the equation for <span class="emphasis"><em>e</em></span>.
      After some algebra, you’ll end up with a formula for <span class="emphasis"><em>J</em></span> that you can then
      use to determine the velocities of each body just after impact. Here’s how that’s done:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>For body 1: |<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1+</sub>| =

    |<span class="emphasis"><em>v</em></span><sub>2+</sub>| into the equation for

      (1/m<sub>1</sub> + 1/m<sub>2</sub>)</td></tr></table><p>Let |<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>r</sub>| =
    (|<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1–</sub>| –
    |<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>2–</sub>|);
    then:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>e |<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>r</sub>|

      1)/(1/m<sub>1</sub> + 1/m<sub>2</sub>)</td></tr></table><p>Since the line of action is normal to the colliding surfaces,
    <span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>r</sub> is the
    relative velocity along the line of action of impact, and <span class="strong"><strong>J</strong></span> acts along the line of action of impact, which
    in this case is normal to the surfaces, as we’ve already stated.</p><p>Now that you have a formula for the impulse, you can use the
    definition of impulse along with this formula to calculate the change in
    linear velocity of the objects involved in the impact. Here’s how that’s
    done in the case of two objects colliding:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td><span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1+</sub> =
      <span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1–</sub> +

      <span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>2–</sub> +
      (–|<span class="strong"><strong>J</strong></span>| <span class="strong"><strong>n</strong></span>)/m<sub>2</sub></td></tr></table><p>Notice that for the second object, the negative of the impulse is
    applied since it acts on both objects equally but in opposite
    directions.</p><p>When dealing with rigid bodies that rotate, you’ll have to derive a
    new equation for impulse that includes angular effects. You’ll use this
    impulse to calculate new linear and angular velocities of the objects just
    after impact. Consider the two objects colliding at point
    <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span>, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#two_colliding_rigid_bodies" title="Figure 5-5. Two colliding rigid bodies">Figure 5-5</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="two_colliding_rigid_bodies"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject5_id313927"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598911.png" alt="Two colliding rigid bodies"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 5-5. Two colliding rigid bodies</div></div><p>There’s a crucial distinction between this collision and that
    discussed earlier. In this case, the velocity at the point of contact on
    each body is a function of not only the objects’ linear velocity but also
    their angular velocities, and you’ll have to recall from <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Kinematics">Chapter 2</a> the following formula in order to calculate the
    velocities at the impact point on each body:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td><span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>p</sub> =

    from the body’s center of gravity to the point
    <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span>.</p><p>Using this formula, you can rewrite the two formulas relating the
    linear velocity after impact to the impulse and initial velocity as
    follows:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>For body 1: <span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1g+</sub> + (<span class="strong"><strong>ω</strong></span><sub>1+</sub> × <span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span><sub>1</sub>) = <span class="strong"><strong>J</strong></span>/m<sub>1</sub> + <span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1g–</sub> + (<span class="strong"><strong>ω</strong></span><sub>1–</sub> × <span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span><sub>1</sub>)</td></tr><tr><td>For body 2: <span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>2g+</sub> + (<span class="strong"><strong>ω</strong></span><sub>2+</sub> × <span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span><sub>2</sub>) = –<span class="strong"><strong>J</strong></span>/m<sub>2</sub> + <span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>2g–</sub> + (<span class="strong"><strong>ω</strong></span><sub>2–</sub> × <span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span><sub>2</sub>)</td></tr></table><p>There are two additional unknowns here, the angular velocities after
    impact, which means that you need two additional equations. You can get
    these equations from the definition of angular impulse:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>For body 1: (<span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span><sub>1</sub> × <span class="strong"><strong>J</strong></span>) = <span class="strong"><strong>I</strong></span><sub>1</sub> (<span class="strong"><strong>ω</strong></span><sub>1+</sub> – <span class="strong"><strong>ω</strong></span><sub>1–</sub>)</td></tr><tr><td>For body 2: (<span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span><sub>2</sub> × –<span class="strong"><strong>J</strong></span>) = <span class="strong"><strong>I</strong></span><sub>2</sub> (<span class="strong"><strong>ω</strong></span><sub>2+</sub> – <span class="strong"><strong>ω</strong></span><sub>2–</sub>)</td></tr></table><p>Here we calculate the moment due to the impulse by taking the vector
    cross product of the impulse with the distance from the body’s center of
    gravity to the point of application of the impulse.</p><p>By combining all of these equations with the equation for
    <span class="emphasis"><em>e</em></span> and following the same procedure used when deriving
    the linear impulse formula, you’ll end up with a formula for |<span class="strong"><strong>J</strong></span>| that takes into account both linear and
    angular effects, which you can then use to find the linear and angular
    velocities of each body immediately after impact. Here’s the
    result:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>|<span class="strong"><strong>J</strong></span>| = –(<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>r</sub>• <span class="strong"><strong>n</strong></span>)(e + 1)/[1/m<sub>1</sub> +

When objects collide in any type of
      collision except direct impact, for that very brief moment of contact, they will experience a
      friction force that acts tangentially to the contacting surfaces. Not only will this
      tangential force change the linear velocities of the colliding objects in the tangential
      direction, but it will also create a moment (torque) on the objects, which tends to change
      their angular velocities. This tangential impulse combined with the normal impulse results in
      an effective line of action of the total collision impulse that is no longer perpendicular to
      the contacting surfaces.</p><p>In practice, it is very difficult to quantify this collision
    friction force due to the fact that the friction force is not necessarily
    constant if the collision is such that the friction force does not develop
    beyond the maximum static friction force. Further complications stem from
    the fact that objects do tend to deform when they collide, creating an
    additional source of resistance. That said, since the friction force is a
    function of the normal force between the contacting surfaces, you know
    that the ratio of the normal force to the friction force is equal to the
    coefficient of friction. If you assume that the collisions are such that
    the kinetic coefficient of friction is applicable, then this ratio is

    means that α will be less than θ.</p><p>The lower force diagram in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#golf_clubngolf_ball_collision" title="Figure 5-6. Golf club–golf ball collision">Figure 5-6</a> illustrates the forces involved
    in this collision with friction. Since the ratio of the tangential
    friction force to the normal collision force is equal to the coefficient
    of friction, you can develop an equation relating the angle φ to the
    coefficient of friction.</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>tan φ = F<sub>f</sub> / F<sub>n</sub> =
      µ</td></tr></table><p>In addition to this friction force changing the linear velocity of
    the ball in the tangential direction, it will also change the angular
    velocity of the ball. Since the friction force is acting on the ball’s
    surface some distance from its center of gravity, it creates a moment
    (torque) about the ball’s center of gravity, which causes the ball to
    spin. You can develop an equation for the new angular velocity of the ball
    in terms of the normal impact force or impulse:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>Σ M<sub>cg</sub> = F<sub>f</sub> r =
      I<sub>cg</sub> dω/dt</td></tr><tr><td>µ F<sub>n</sub> r = I<sub>cg</sub>
      dω/dt</td></tr><tr><td>µ F<sub>n</sub> r dt = I<sub>cg</sub>
      dω</td></tr><tr><td>ȫ<sub>(t– to t+)</sub> F<sub>n</sub> dt
      = I<sub>cg</sub> / (µ r) ȫ<sub>(ω– to ω+)</sub>
      ω dω</td></tr></table><p>Notice here that the integral on the left is the normal impulse;
    thus:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>Impulse = I<sub>cg</sub> / (µ r)
      (ω<sub>+</sub> – ω<sub>–</sub>)</td></tr><tr><td>ω<sub>+</sub> = (Impulse) (µ r) /
      I<sub>cg</sub> + ω<sub>–</sub></td></tr></table><p>This relation looks very similar to the <a id="I_indexterm5_id315035" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id315044" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id315054" class="indexterm"/>angular impulse equation that we showed you earlier in this
    chapter, and you can use it to approximate the friction-induced spin in
    specific collision problems.</p><p>Turn back to the equation for impulse, <span class="emphasis"><em>J</em></span>, in
    the last section that includes both linear and angular effects. Here it is
    again for convenience:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>|<span class="strong"><strong>J</strong></span>| = –(<span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>r</sub>• <span class="strong"><strong>n</strong></span>)(e + 1) / [1/m<sub>1</sub> +
      1/m<sub>2</sub> + <span class="strong"><strong>n</strong></span>
      •((<span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span><sub>1</sub> ×
      <span class="strong"><strong>n</strong></span>)/<span class="strong"><strong>I</strong></span><sub>1</sub>) × <span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span><sub>1</sub> + <span class="strong"><strong>n</strong></span> • ((<span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span><sub>2</sub> × <span class="strong"><strong>n</strong></span>)/<span class="strong"><strong>I</strong></span><sub>2</sub>) × <span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span><sub>2</sub>]</td></tr></table><p>This formula gives you the collision impulse in the normal
    direction. To see how friction fits in you must keep in mind that friction
    acts tangentially to the contacting surfaces, that combining the friction
    force with the normal impact force yields a new effective line of action
    for the collision, and that the friction force (and impulse) is a function
    of the normal force (impulse) and coefficient of friction. Considering all
    these factors, the new equations to calculate the change in linear and
    angular velocities of two colliding objects are as follows:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td><span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1+</sub> =
      <span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>1–</sub> + (J

      <span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>2–</sub> + (–J

      <span class="strong"><strong>ω</strong></span><sub>1–</sub> +
      (<span class="strong"><strong>r</strong></span><sub>1</sub> × (J

      <span class="strong"><strong>n</strong></span>+ (µ J) <span class="strong"><strong>t</strong></span>)) / <span class="strong"><strong>I</strong></span><sub>cg</sub></td></tr></table><p>In these equations, <span class="strong"><strong>t</strong></span> is the unit
    tangent vector, which is tangent to the collision surfaces and at a right
    angle to the unit normal vector. You can calculate the tangent vector if
    you know the unit normal vector and the relative velocity vector in the
    same plane as the normal vector.</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td><span class="strong"><strong>t</strong></span> = (<span class="strong"><strong>n</strong></span> × <span class="strong"><strong>v</strong></span><sub>r</sub>) × <span class="strong"><strong>n</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="strong"><strong>t</strong></span> = <span class="strong"><strong>t</strong></span> / |<span class="strong"><strong>t</strong></span>|</td></tr></table><p>For many problems that you’ll face, you may be able to reasonably
    neglect friction in your collision response routines since its effect may
    be small compared to the effect of the normal impulse itself. However, for
    some types of problems, friction is crucial. For example, the flight
    trajectory of a golf ball depends greatly on the spin imparted to it as a
    result of the club–ball collision. We’ll discuss how spin affects
    trajectory in the next chapter, which covers projectile <a id="I_indexterm5_id315440" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id315449" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id315459" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id315468" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm5_id315477" class="indexterm"/>motion.</p></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr style="width: 100; align: left;"/><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.CHP-5-FN-1"><p><sup>[<a href="#CHP-5-FN-1" class="para">13</a>] </sup>We use the classical approach in this book and are mentioning penalty methods only to
