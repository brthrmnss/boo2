In that case we used a constant value of drag coefficient that was arbitrarily defined.  As we said earlier, it would be better to use the formula presented in this chapter for total drag along with the total drag coefficient data shown in Figure 6 9 to estimate the drag on the projectile.  While this is more  \"accurate,\"  it does complicate matters for you.  Specifically, the drag coefficient is now a function of the Reynolds number, which is a function of velocity.  You'll have to set up a table of drag coefficients versus the Reynolds number and interpolate this table given the Reynolds number calculated at each time step.  As an alternative, you can fit the drag coefficient data to a curve to derive a formula that you can use instead; however, the drag coefficient data may be such that you'll have to use a piecewise approach and derive curve fits for each segment of the drag coefficient curve.  The sphere data presented herein is one such case.  The data does not lend itself nicely to a single polynomial curve fit over the full range of the Reynolds number.  In such cases, you'll end up with a handful of formulas for drag coefficient, with each formula valid over a limited range of Reynolds numbers.",

After all, the right answer for a game is that it's fun and robust.  Speaking of robustness, other folks view tuning in the sense of adjusting parameters to make the simulation stable.

Self capacitance screens take advantage of a physical property defined by the amount of electrical charge that must be added to an isolated conductor to raise its potential by one volt.  When the fingers act as a conductor of the body's inherent capacitance, the sensors on the other side of the glass experience a rise in electric potential.  Given that the sensors are on the other side of a good insulator, glass, there won't actually be any discharge of energy, unlike when you touch your metal car door and get  \"zapped.\"  Self capacitance in this manner produces a very strong signal but lacks the ability to accurately resolve multiple touches.

First, most of us are familiar with the  \"megapixel\"  metric used to describe digital cameras.  This number is a measure of how many pixels of information the camera records in a single frame.  It is equal to the height of the frame in pixels multiplied by the width of the frame in pixels.  A pixel, or picture element, contains information on intensity, color, and the location of the pixel relative to some origin.  The amount of information depends on the bits per pixel and corresponds to the amount of color variation a particular pixel can display.  Perhaps you've seen your graphics set to 16 bit or 24 bit modes.  This describes how many colors a particular pixel can display.  A 24 bit pixel can be one of 16.8 million different colors at any instant.  It is commonly held that the human eye can differentiate among about 10 million colors; 24 bit color is called  \"true color,\"  as it can display more colors than your eye can recognize.  You might also see 32 bit color modes; these include an extra 8 bits for a transparency channel that tells the computer what to do if this image were put on top of another image.
