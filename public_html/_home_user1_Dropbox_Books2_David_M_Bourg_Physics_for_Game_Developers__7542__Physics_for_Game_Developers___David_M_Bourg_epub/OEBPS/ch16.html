While the same principles govern canoes and super tankers,
    the difference between the two scales is not trivial. Our goal in this chapter will be to
    explain some of the fundamental physical principles to allow you to develop realistic
    simulations. The typical displacement-type ship lends itself well to illustrating these
    principles; however, many of these principles also apply to other objects submerged or partially
    submerged in a fluid, such as submarines and air balloons. Remember, air is considered a fluid
    when we are considering buoyancy.</p><p>While surface ships or ships that operate on the water’s surface (at
  the air water interface) are similar to fully submerged objects like
  submarines or air balloons in that they all experience buoyancy, there are
  some very distinct differences in their physical nature that we’ll highlight
  in this chapter. These differences affect their behavior, so it is important
  to be aware of them if you intend to simulate such objects.</p><p>Ships have an entire language of their own, so we’ll be spending a lot
  of time just getting the vocabulary right. This will allow you to do further
  research on any topics that are of particular interest. There are many ways
  to classify ships and boats, but in regards to the physics governing them,
  there are three basic <a id="I_indexterm2_id341026" class="indexterm"/>types. <span class="emphasis"><em>Displacement</em></span> vessels,
  <span class="emphasis"><em>semi-displacement</em></span> vessels, and
  <span class="emphasis"><em>planing</em></span> vessels are named after the forces that keep
  the boat afloat while it is at cruising speed. When not moving, all vessels
  are in <span class="emphasis"><em>displacement mode</em></span>.</p><p>The term <span class="emphasis"><em>displacement</em></span> in <a id="I_indexterm2_id341059" class="indexterm"/>this context means that the ship is supported solely by
  buoyancy—that is, without dynamic or aerostatic lift as you would see on a
  high-speed racing boat or a hovercraft. The word
  <span class="emphasis"><em>displacement</em></span> itself refers to the volume of water
  displaced or “pushed” out of the way by the ship as it sits floating in the
  water. We’ll discuss this more in the next section.</p><p>A planing vessel is <a id="I_indexterm2_id341081" class="indexterm"/>one that is not supported by buoyancy, but by <a id="I_indexterm2_id341089" class="indexterm"/>hydrodynamic lift. This includes the everyday speedboats that most boaters own. When
    the boat isn’t moving, it just floats in the water, bobbing up and down. However, when the boat
    begins traveling at high speed, the force of the water hitting the bottom of the boat causes the
    boat to rise up. This is known as planing, and it greatly reduces the resistance of the vessel.
    Semi-displacement vessels are those that straddle the two categories, with some support coming
    from buoyancy and some coming from planing forces. Before we continue discussing this, let’s go
    over some vocabulary.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>hull</em></span> of the <a id="I_indexterm2_id341112" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id341118" class="indexterm"/>ship is the watertight part of the ship that actually
  displaces the water. Everything in or on the ship is contained within the
  hull, which is partially submerged in the water. The length <a id="I_indexterm2_id341131" class="indexterm"/>of the ship is the distance measured from the bow to the
  stern. In practice, there are several lengths used to denote the length of a
  ship, but here we’ll refer to the <span class="emphasis"><em>overall length</em></span> of the
  hull. The <span class="emphasis"><em>bow</em></span> is the front of the ship, while the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>stern</em></span> is the aft part. When you are on the ship facing
  the bow, the <span class="emphasis"><em>port</em></span> side is to your left and the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>starboard</em></span> side is to your right. The overall height of
  the hull is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>depth</em></span>, and its width is called
  <span class="emphasis"><em>breadth</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>beam</em></span>. When a ship is
  floating in the water, the distance from the water surface to the bottom of
  the hull is called <a id="I_indexterm2_id341176" class="indexterm"/>the <span class="emphasis"><em>draft</em></span>. <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#ship_geometry" title="Figure 16-1. Ship geometry">Figure 16-1</a> illustrates these terms.</p><div class="figure"><a id="ship_geometry"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_id341205"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598970.png" alt="Ship geometry"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 16-1. Ship geometry</div></div><p>Given that ship design is a diverse subject, we’ll limit ourselves to
  discussing those aspects of ships that make for realistic models. These
  subjects include stability and sinking, resistance characteristics,
  propulstion, and manuverability. Most of these subjects cannot be fully
  simulated in real time, so we’ll show you some general rules that ships
  follow instead of full numerical <a id="I_indexterm2_id341229" class="indexterm"/>simulation.</p><div class="sect1" title="Stability and Sinking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="stability_and_sinking">Stability and Sinking</h2></div></div></div><p>If you have boats in your video game, the first step to making them
    realistic physically is allowing them to sink if they become damaged. To
    understand why boats sink and how they do so, you must first understand
    <span class="emphasis"><em>stability</em></span>.</p><div class="sect2" title="Stability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="stability">Stability</h3></div></div></div><p>Most boats <a id="sh16.1.1" class="indexterm"/><a id="st16.1.1" class="indexterm"/>are least stable about their longitudinal axis—that is,
      they are easier to heel port and starboard than they are to flip end
      over end. If the vessel heels over so far that it is upside down, this
      is called capsizing. <a id="I_indexterm2_id341301" class="indexterm"/>This is how most boats sink due to wind, waves, or in some
      cases of side damage. One of the most famous examples of a sinking ship,
      the <span class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span>, shows that when a boat is sinking from
      damage, it can sink end over end, sometimes with the ship breaking in
      two. We’ll discuss both here so that you can animate realistic sinking
      in your simulation.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Force">Chapter 3</a> we introduced the concept of buoyancy
      and stated that the force on a submerged object due to buoyancy is a
      function of the submerged <a id="I_indexterm2_id341326" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id341332" class="indexterm"/>volume of the object. <a id="I_indexterm2_id341343" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id341350" class="indexterm"/>Archimedes’s principle states that the <a id="I_indexterm2_id341363" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id341373" class="indexterm"/>weight of an object floating in a fluid is equal to the
      weight of the volume of fluid displaced by the object. This is an
      important principle. It says that a ship of a given weight must have
      sufficient volume to displace enough water, an amount equal to the
      weight of the ship, in order for it to float. Further, this principle
      provides a clever way of determining the weight of a ship: simply
      measure or calculate the amount of water displaced by the ship and you
      can calculate the weight of the ship. In the marine field, <a id="I_indexterm2_id341389" class="indexterm"/>displacement is synonymous with the weight of the
      ship.</p><p>As discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Force">Chapter 3</a>, we can calculate the
      buoyant force on any object by using the following formula:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>F<sub>B</sub> = ρ g ∇</td></tr></table><p>Here, ∇ is the submerged volume of the object, ρ is the density of
      the fluid within which the object is submerged, and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>g</em></span> is the acceleration due to gravity. Since
      buoyancy is a force, it has both magnitude and direction, and always
      acts straight up through the center of buoyancy. The center of buoyancy
      is the geometric center of the submerged part of the object.</p><p>When a ship is floating in equilibrium on the surface of the
      water, its center of buoyancy must be located directly below the ship’s
      <a id="I_indexterm2_id341437" class="indexterm"/>center of gravity. The weight of the ship, a force, acts
      straight down through the center of gravity, opposing the force due to
      buoyancy. When the ship is in equilibrium, these two forces, weight and
      buoyancy, are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.</p><p>Now, when an external force causes the ship to <a id="I_indexterm2_id341457" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id341469" class="indexterm"/>roll or pitch, the portion of the hull below the water is
      changed and the center of buoyancy moves to the new geometric centroid
      of the underwater portion of the hull. For example, if the ship rolls to
      the starboard side, then the center of buoyancy shiwfts out toward the
      starboard side. When this happens, the lines of action of the weight of
      the ship and the buoyant force are no longer in line, which results in a
      moment (torque) that acts on the ship. This torque is equal to the
      perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces times
      the weight of the ship.</p><p>Now here’s where we get to the floating upright part that we
      mentioned earlier. When a ship rolls, for example, you don’t want it to
      keep rolling until it capsizes. Instead, you want it to gently return
      itself to the upright position after whatever force caused it to
      roll—the wind, for example—has been removed. In short, you want the ship
      to be stable. For a ship to be stable, the line of action of the buoyant
      force must cross the vessel’s centerline at a point, called <a id="I_indexterm2_id341497" class="indexterm"/>the <span class="emphasis"><em>metacenter</em></span>, above the center of
      gravity. When this happens, the moment developed when the ship rolls
      tends to restore the ship to the upright position. If the metacenter is
      located below the center of gravity, then the moment developed would
      tend to capsize the ship. The distance between the center of gravity and
      the metacenter is called <span class="emphasis"><em>GM</em></span>. This is also known as
      <a id="I_indexterm2_id341515" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id341521" class="indexterm"/>the <span class="emphasis"><em>stability index</em></span>, as a positive
      value means the floating body is stable and a negative GM means the body
      is unstable. <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#ship_stability" title="Figure 16-2. Ship stability">Figure 16-2</a> illustrates these two
      scenarios.</p><div class="figure"><a id="ship_stability"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_id341548"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598971.png" alt="Ship stability"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 16-2. Ship stability</div></div><p>If you’re a sailor, then you know how important it is to keep the
      center of gravity of your boat low. This helps increase the height of
      the metacenter above the center of gravity, and thus helps with
      stability.</p><p>In the case of fully submerged objects, like submarines, the
      situation is different. The buoyant force still acts through the
      geometric centroid of the object, but for stability, the center of
      buoyancy must be located above the center of gravity. This way, when the
      object rotates, the lines of action of the weight of the object and the
      buoyant force are separated and form a moment that tends to restore the
      object to its upright position. If it’s the other way around, then the
      object would be unstable, like trying to balance one bowling ball on top
      of another. In this case, the slightest disturbance would upset the
      balance and the object would flip upside-down such that the center of
      gravity is located below the center of <a id="I_indexterm2_id341580" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id341591" class="indexterm"/>buoyancy.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Sinking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="sinking">Sinking</h3></div></div></div><p>In general, <a id="I_indexterm2_id341615" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id341625" class="indexterm"/>boats protect their stability by compartmentalizing the
      hull into several watertight sections, fittingly <a id="I_indexterm2_id341633" class="indexterm"/>called <span class="emphasis"><em>compartments</em></span>. This way, if the
      side of a vessel hits an iceberg, only the compartment damaged will
      flood with seawater. If enough compartments are damaged, the vessel will
      not have enough buoyancy to support its weight and it will sink. The end
      with the flooded compartments will sink first, causing a large angle
      about the transverse axis. This is what happened to the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span>. In fact, in that ship’s case, the angle,
      called <span class="emphasis"><em>trim</em></span>, was so large that the stern was lifted
      out of the water. The hull could not support the weight of the stern
      section that was no longer being supported by buoyancy, and the
      structure ripped in two.</p><p>It should be noted that ships can sink in the matter of minutes,
      or it can take hours. For instance, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span>
      took about three hours to sink. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Lusitania</em></span> sank
      in 18 minutes. The time it takes depends heavily on the type of damage
      and the construction of the vessel. We don’t suggest trying to get
      players to wait three hours for their game to end; however, it is
      possible to continue fighting/propelling a vessel that is terminally
      damaged. In many cases where terminal damage is suspected, captains
      endeavor to ground their vessels to prevent the ship from actually going
      under.</p><p>If side damage occurs, especially in high wind and waves, then it
      could be that the vessel can still have enough buoyancy to float, but no
      longer enough stability to remain upright. As damage usually occurs only
      on one side of a vessel, the center of buoyancy will no longer be on
      centerline. This means that the restoring moment in one direction is
      diminished by whatever amount the center has moved to that side. A big
      wave comes along and pushes the vessel over to the point where the
      righting arm is no longer positive. The vessel will flip 180 degrees
      with the bottom pointed skyward but will still <a id="I_indexterm2_id341681" class="indexterm"/>float (capsizing). Once rolled over, the remaining
      compartments will tend to fill with water as vents or other openings
      fail over time. In the case of recreational boats, they are usually only
      a single compartment. If they capsize, they will sink readily; indeed,
      this is the way that most small boats sink.</p><p>As we mentioned before, accurately computing all degrees
      <a id="I_indexterm2_id341694" class="indexterm"/>of freedom for a nontrivial-shaped body in real time would
      be difficult to accomplish with today’s computer hardware. In general,
      you want to follow a few high-level rules:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The higher the center of gravity, the more likely it is that
          the boat will tip over.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Large vessels are always compartmentalized. Damage should be
          limited to the watertight compartment in which it occurred.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The vessel will heal or trim in the direction of damage. If
          damage occurs on the starboard side, the boat will heel to
          starboard. If the damage occurs in the bow, the boat will list
          forward.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A boat will remain floating as long as the undamaged
          compartments have a volume in cubic meters of at least the weight of
          the hull in metric tons divided by 1.025.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>After being damaged, even if a vessel has enough undamaged
          volume to remain afloat, it doesn’t necessarily mean it will float
          upright.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Sinking almost never occurs as quickly as depicted in video
          games; however, capsizing can occur rapidly and is probably a more
          realistic way to model a stability failure.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Ship Motions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="ship_motions">Ship Motions</h2></div></div></div><p>Closely related to <a id="sh16.2" class="indexterm"/><a id="mo16.2" class="indexterm"/>ship stability is the subject of ship motions. Knowing how
    vessels work in a random set of waves will greatly help you to increase
    realism in your games. The most important aspect of this is<a id="I_indexterm2_id341813" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id341819" class="indexterm"/> coupled motions, which we will talk about shortly. First,
    some more vocabulary! As discussed before, there are six degrees of motion
    any rigid body is capable of; for boats, <a id="de16.2" class="indexterm"/>some of these have special names and are described next and
    illustrated in <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#floating-body_degrees_of_freedom" title="Figure 16-3. Floating-body degrees of freedom">Figure 16-3</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="floating-body_degrees_of_freedom"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_id341862"/><img style="width: 194.88188976378; " src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598972.png" alt="Floating-body degrees of freedom"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 16-3. Floating-body degrees of freedom</div></div><p>Roll, pitch, <a id="I_indexterm2_id341884" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id341896" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id341909" class="indexterm"/>and yaw are the terms also used for airplanes. The
    translation degrees of freedom are called surge, heave, and sway. Surge,
    sway, and yaw are not that apparent when vessels are moving forward, so it
    is acceptable to limit your model to heave, pitch, and roll. <a id="I_indexterm2_id341924" class="indexterm"/>Heave is the up-and-down motion of the boat caused by the
    change in elevation of the water’s surface as a wave passes. If a vessel
    is stationary, it would be referred to as bobbing. Pitch is the rotation
    about the transverse axis of the vessel due to increased buoyancy on one
    end of the ship as a wave passes. This motion is most pronounced when the
    waves are traveling in the same direction (or 180 degrees) from the
    vessel. Roll is like pitch, but about the longitudinal axis.</p><div class="sect2" title="Heave"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="heave">Heave</h3></div></div></div><p>As stated <a id="I_indexterm2_id341948" class="indexterm"/>before, heave is displacement in the vertical direction
        from the static equilibrium draft. This degree of freedom is
        straightforward to model as a hydrostatic spring acting in the
        vertical direction. Assuming we have a barge that is 30 meters long
        and 10 meters wide, we’ll develop an equation that can govern our
        heave simulation.</p><p>Commonly, a vessel’s hydrostatics include something called <a id="I_indexterm2_id341962" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id341969" class="indexterm"/>tons per centimeter immersion (TPCM)—that is, for every centimeter you press
          the boat down, a certain number of tons of buoyancy force is created. For our barge, this
          is a relatively straightforward calculation.</p><p>Given that the water plane area is a constant 300 square meters,
        1 centimeter of immersion would result in a volume of 3 cubic meters.
        As 1 cubic meter of saltwater weighs 1,027 kg, 3 cubic meters would be
        3,081 kg, and (assuming this boat is on Earth), would result in a
        buoyant force of 3,081 kg × 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>, or
        30.2 kN. Therefore, 30.2 kN per cm would make a good starting value
        for a spring constant to model the heave response of this vessel in
        waves.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Roll"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="roll">Roll</h3></div></div></div><p>For us to <a id="I_indexterm2_id342003" class="indexterm"/>simulate realistic roll motions, it is important that
        the ship take time to complete the motion. This <a id="I_indexterm2_id342018" class="indexterm"/>time is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>roll period</em></span>.
        This defines the angular velocity that a ship rolled to one side will
        experience when it recovers. We can estimate it by the following
        equation:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>T = 
          
            <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="inleq_1601.png" alt=""/></span>   
            
          </td></tr></table><p>Where <span class="emphasis"><em>k</em></span> is the radius of gyration and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>GM</em></span> is the distance from the metacenter to the
        center of gravity. A good estimate for the radius of gyration is often
        taken as 30% of the beam of the vessel. A vessel with a shorter roll
        period will respond quicker to a wave and try to assume the wave
        slope. This is known as being “stiff” and can cause passenger
        discomfort and damage via higher angular accelerations. Conversely,
        vessels with higher roll periods are known as “tender” and lag behind
        the waves. These vessels generally heel farther over but are more
        comfortable for passengers.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Pitch"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="pitch">Pitch</h3></div></div></div><p>Likewise, <a id="I_indexterm2_id342080" class="indexterm"/>there is a pitch period that measures the speed at which the vessel responds
          to a wave. This is highly dependent on the length of a ship and can be estimated as
          follows:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>T = (2π /
          g<sup>1/2</sup>)(k/(GM)<sup>1/2</sup>)</td></tr></table><p>Where <span class="emphasis"><em>k</em></span> is the radius of gyration and is
        commonly taken as 30% of the beam. Note that pitch period is normally
        one-third to one-half that of roll period, so that the bow of a vessel
        will rise and fall with the wave more in phase <a id="I_indexterm2_id342122" class="indexterm"/>than in a roll event.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Coupled Motions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="coupled_motions">Coupled Motions</h3></div></div></div><p>The real trick to <a id="I_indexterm2_id342145" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id342152" class="indexterm"/>getting motions to look right is to understand that for most boats the motions
        are coupled. For instance, heave and pitch are strongly coupled. This means that if a wave
        causes your boat to heave, it will most likely also cause it to pitch. This is because the
        distribution of buoyancy along the hull is not constant. If the waterline is raised some
        constant value, there is usually more buoyancy provided aft than there is forward for the
        same change in waterline. This will cause the vessel to pitch forward to move the center of
        buoyancy to the longitudinal location of the center of gravity. Similarly, a pitch event
        will cause the vessel to heave because if the stern is lifted from the water, there is

Specifically, we
        discussed frictional and pressure drag. Ships moving on the water’s surface experience these
        drag forces; however, at the air-water interface, there are other drag components that you
        have to consider. If you were to write an equation breaking up the total resistance acting
        on a ship into its three main components, that equation would look something like
        this:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>total</sub> =
        R<sub>friction</sub> + R<sub>pressure</sub> +
        R<sub>waves</sub></td></tr></table><p>We’ll describe each of these components and give you some
      empirical formulas in just a moment. First, however, we want to qualify
      the material to follow by saying it is very general in nature and
      applicable only when little detail is known about the complete geometry
      of the particular ship under consideration. In the practice of ship
      design, these formulas would be used only in the very early stages of
      the design process to approximate resistance. That said, they are very
      useful for getting in the ballpark, so to speak, and (sometimes more
      importantly) in performing parametric studies to see the effects of
      changes in major parameters.</p><p>The first resistance component is the frictional drag<a id="I_indexterm2_id342314" class="indexterm"/> on the underwater surface of the hull as it moves through
      the water. This is the same as the frictional drag that we discussed in
      <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Force">Chapter 3</a>. However, for ships there’s a convenient set of
      empirical formulas that you can use to calculate this force:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>friction</sub> = (1/2) ρ
        V<sup>2</sup> S C<sub>f</sub></td></tr></table><p>In this formula, ρ is the density of water, <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span>
      is the speed of the ship, <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> is the surface area of
      the underwater portion of the hull, and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>f</sub> is the coefficient of
      frictional resistance. You can use this empirical formula to calculate
      <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>f</sub>:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>C<sub>f</sub> = 0.075 / (log10 Rn – 2)2</td></tr></table><p>Here, <span class="emphasis"><em>Rn</em></span> is the <a id="I_indexterm2_id342398" class="indexterm"/>Reynolds number, as defined in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Projectiles">Chapter 6</a>, based on the length of the ship’s hull. This
      formula was adopted in 1957 by the International Towing Tank Conference
      (ITTC)<a id="I_indexterm2_id342412" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id342418" class="indexterm"/> and is widely used in the field of naval architecture for
      estimating frictional resistance coefficients for ships.</p><p>To apply the formula for R<sub>friction</sub>, you’ll
      also have to know the surface area, <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>, of the
      underwater portion of the hull. You can directly calculate this area
      using numerical integration techniques, similar to those for calculating
      volume, or you can use yet another empirical formula:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>S = C<sub>ws</sub>
          √(∇L)
        </td></tr></table><p>In this formula, ∇ is the displaced volume, <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span>
      the length of the ship, and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>ws</sub> is the wetted surface
      coefficient. This coefficient is a function of the ship’s shape—its
      breadth-to-draft ratio—and <a id="I_indexterm2_id342469" class="indexterm"/>statistically it ranges from 2.6 to 2.9 for typical
      displacement hull forms.</p><p>The pressure drag <a id="I_indexterm2_id342479" class="indexterm"/>experienced by a ship is the same as that experienced by
      projectiles as discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Force">Chapter 3</a>. Remember, this
      drag is due to the viscous effects causing a region of relatively low
      pressure behind the ship. Quantifying this force is difficult for ships
      of arbitrary geometry. We can use computational fluid dynamics
      algorithms to approximate this force, but this requires detailed
      knowledge of the hull geometry and a whole lot of time-consuming
      computations. An alternative is to rely on scale-model test data where
      results from the model test are extrapolated to approximate drag on the
      full-size ship.</p><p>Just like pressure drag, wave drag is <a id="I_indexterm2_id342502" class="indexterm"/>difficult to compute, and we usually rely on model testing
      in practice. Wave drag is due to the energy transfer, or momentum
      transfer, from the ship to the fluid, or in other words, it’s a function
      of the work done by the ship on the surrounding fluid to generate the
      waves. The visible presence of wave resistance is evident in the large
      bow wave that builds up at the front of the ship as well as the wave
      system that originates at the stern of the ship as it moves through the
      water. These waves affect the pressure distribution around the ship and
      thus affect the pressure drag, which makes it difficult for us to
      separate the wave drag component from pressure drag when performing an
      analysis.</p><p>When scale model tests are performed, pressure drag and wave drag
      are usually lumped together in <a id="I_indexterm2_id342520" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id342526" class="indexterm"/>what’s known as <span class="emphasis"><em>residual resistance</em></span>.
      Analogous to the coefficient of frictional drag, you can determine a
      coefficient of residual resistance, such that:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>r</sub> = R<sub>pressure</sub> +
        R<sub>wave</sub> = (1/2) ρ V<sup>2</sup> S
        C<sub>r</sub></td></tr></table><p>Here <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span><sub>r</sub> is the total
      residual resistance, and <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>r</sub>
      is the coefficient of residual resistance.</p><p>There are many resistance estimation methods available that allow
      you to estimate the coefficient of residual resistance for a ship;
      however, they are usually presented for specific ship types. For
      example, one method might give empirical formulas for
      <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>r</sub> for destroyer-type ships,
      while another might give formulas for
      <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>r</sub> for large oil tankers.
      The trick, of course, is to choose a method appropriate for the type of
      ship you are analyzing.<sup>[<a id="CHP-16-FN-1" href="#ftn.CHP-16-FN-1" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">29</a>]</sup> Generally, <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>r</sub>
      increases as the displacement and speed of the ship increase. A typical
      range for <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>r</sub> for large
      displacement hulls is from 1.0e–3 to 3.0e–3.</p><p>While these three resistance components—friction, pressure, and
      wave—are the most important for typical displacement-type ships, they
      aren’t the only ones. Since a ship operates at the air-water interface,
      a large part of its structure is above the water surface, exposed to the
      air. This means that the ship will also experience air resistance.
      <a id="I_indexterm2_id342642" class="indexterm"/>You can approximate this air resistance using the
      following formula:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>R<sub>air</sub> = (1/2) ρ
        V<sup>2</sup> A<sub>p</sub>
        C<sub>air</sub></td></tr></table><p>Here, <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>air</sub> is the coefficient of air
        resistance, ρ is the density of air, <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> is the speed of the ship, and
          <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span><sub>p</sub> is the projected transverse (profile) area
        of the ship. <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span><sub>air</sub> typically ranges from 0.6 to
        1.1, depending on the type of ship. Tankers and large cargo ships tend to be near the upper
        end of the range, while combatant ships tend to be near the lower end. In lieu of enough
        information to calculate the projected transverse area of the ship, you can approximate it
        by:</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>A<sub>p</sub> =
        B<sup>2</sup>/2</td></tr></table><p>where <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> is the breadth (width) of the
      <a id="I_indexterm2_id342734" class="indexterm"/>ship.</p><div class="sect3" title="Planing craft"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="planing_craft">Planing craft</h4></div></div></div><p>Planing craft <a id="I_indexterm2_id342759" class="indexterm"/>are different than displacement vessels in that when
        they reach their cruising speed they are not supported by buoyancy.
        Unlike a super tanker, a recreational speedboat has a much “flatter”
        hull form. It almost looks like a very fat foil, which it is! When a
        speedboat is just sitting in the water it is fully supported by its
        buoyancy, just like a tanker. However, as the boat starts moving
        forward, the hull is at an angle of attack to the water. Like a super
        tanker, the boat is also creating a wave in front of it as it moves,
        called the <span class="emphasis"><em>bow wave</em></span>. However, similar to an
        airplane breaking the sound barrier, a planing craft is fast enough to
        catch up to this wave. As it reaches its own bow wave, the vessel will
        start to tilt backward. This tilting increases the resistance by
        virtue of increasing the angle of attack of the vessel’s hull.
        However, if the vessel has additional power to overcome this increased
        resistance, the lift force generated from the hull foil will begin to
        lift the hull out of the water. At this point, the forces in <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#forces_on_a_planing_craft" title="Figure 16-4. Forces on a planing craft">Figure 16-4</a> begin to dominate.</p><div class="figure"><a id="forces_on_a_planing_craft"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_id342796"/><img style="width: 290.551181102362; " src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598973.png" alt="Forces on a planing craft"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 16-4. Forces on a planing craft</div></div><p>As you can see, compared to when the boat is at rest, very
        little of the hull is in the water now. This, in turn, provides
        positive feedback because it reduces the wetted surface area and
        <a id="I_indexterm2_id342820" class="indexterm"/>skin friction and allows the craft to go faster,
        generating more lift and reducing the skin friction yet again.
        Simultaneously, the drag created by the foil moving through the fluid
        increases until eventually the available power is exhausted and top
        speed is attained. If we plot the resistance versus speed, it might
        look something like <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#planing_craft_resistance_versus_speed" title="Figure 16-5. Planing craft resistance versus speed">Figure 16-5</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="planing_craft_resistance_versus_speed"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_id342852"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598974.png" alt="Planing craft resistance versus speed"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 16-5. Planing craft resistance versus speed</div></div><p>Notice the hump region. This is where the vessel trims aft in
        the transition mode and there is a rise in the resistance. There have
        been embarrassing cases where a vessel, although having enough power
        to make the design speed once over the humps, lacked the power to make
        the transition.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Virtual mass"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="virtual_mass">Virtual mass</h4></div></div></div><p>The <a id="I_indexterm2_id342892" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id342898" class="indexterm"/>concept of <span class="emphasis"><em>virtual mass</em></span> is
        important for calculating the acceleration of a ship in a real-time
        simulator. Virtual mass is equal to the mass of the ship plus the mass
        of the water that is accelerated with the ship.</p><p>Back in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Force">Chapter 3</a> we told you about the viscous boundary layer, <a id="I_indexterm2_id342924" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id342930" class="indexterm"/>and we said that the relative velocity (relative to the moving body) of the
          fluid particles near the moving body’s surface is 0 at the body surface and increases to
          the free stream velocity as distance from the body surface increases. Essentially, some of
          the fluid sticks to the body as it moves and is accelerated with the body. Since the
          velocity of the fluid varies within the boundary layer, so does the acceleration. The
            <span class="emphasis"><em>added mass</em></span>, the mass of water that gets accelerated, is a weighted
          integration of the entire mass of fluid that is affected by the body’s
          acceleration.</p><p>For a ship, the viscous boundary layer can be quite thick, up to several feet near the
          end of the ship depending on its length, and the mass of water that gets accelerated is
          significant. Therefore, when doing any sort of analysis that involves the acceleration of
          the ship, you need to consider added mass, too. The calculation of added mass is beyond
          the scope of this book. We should also point out that, unlike mass, added mass is a
          tensor—that is, it depends on the direction of acceleration. Further, added mass applies
          to both linear and angular motion.</p><p>Added mass is typically expressed in terms of an added mass
        coefficient, which equals the added mass divided by the mass of the
        ship. Some methods actually integrate over the actual hull surface,
        while others approximate the hull as an ellipsoid with proportions
        matching the ship’s. Using this approximation, the ellipsoid’s length
        corresponds to the ship’s length while its width corresponds to the
        ship’s breadth. For longitudinal motion (that is, linear motion along
        an axis parallel to the ship’s length), the added mass coefficient
        varies nearly linearly from 0.0 at a breadth-to-length ratio
        <a id="I_indexterm2_id342968" class="indexterm"/>of 0 (the ship is infinitely thin) up to 0.5 at a
        breadth-to-length ratio of 1 (a sphere).</p><p>When the added mass coefficient is expressed as a percentage of
        the ship’s mass, virtual mass can be calculated as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>mv</em></span> = <span class="emphasis"><em>m</em></span> (1 +
        <span class="emphasis"><em>xa</em></span>), where <span class="emphasis"><em>m</em></span> is mass, and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>xa</em></span> is the added mass coefficient—for example, 0.2
        for 20%. For typical displacement ship proportions, the longitudinal
        added mass ranges from about 4% to 15% of the mass of the ship.
        Conservative estimates generally use 20%.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Guidance speeds"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="guidance_speeds">Guidance speeds</h4></div></div></div><p>To provide some guidance, <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#some_vessels_and_their_speeds" title="Table 16-1. Some vessels and their speeds">Table 16-1</a> provides common <a id="I_indexterm2_id343020" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id343030" class="indexterm"/>ship types and appropriate speed ranges.

      oldest is by way of sails using the wind. The physics of sailing could
      fill several chapters on its own, so we won’t go into detail here. If
      you are interested in that topic, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Physics of Sailing
      Explained</em></span> (Sheridan House), by <a id="I_indexterm2_id343485" class="indexterm"/>Bryon Anderson, is a good starting point. You can also
      check out the airplane chapter in this book and note that a sail is just
      a vertical wing. We will say this: if you choose to put a sailing vessel
      in your simulation, make sure to remember the golden rule! You cannot
      generally sail within 45 degrees of the direction the wind is coming
      from.</p><p>There are many different kinds of propulsion: rudders, shafted
      fixed-pitch propellers, shafted CPP propellers, azimuthing thrusters,
      propellers in nozzles, water jets, pump jets, contra-rotating, and the
      very odd Voith Schneider type. We can’t get into all of them here, but
      the aforementioned list should get you started if you are interesting in
      modeling the specifics of different propulsor types.</p><p>The major propulsion relationship for your simulation would be
      <a id="I_indexterm2_id343506" class="indexterm"/>the thrust-to-propeller RPM or <a id="I_indexterm2_id343515" class="indexterm"/>thrust-to-throttle curve. The fly in the ointment here is
      that thrust is also dependent on forward speed. As the boat moves faster
      and faster through the water, the inflow velocity of the water into the
      propeller is higher and higher. This means that the difference between
      the velocity of the intake and the velocity of the output is smaller,
      reducing the amount of thrust. In general, the thrust curve versus boat
      speed will look like <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#speed_versus_required_thrust" title="Figure 16-6. Speed versus required thrust">Figure 16-6</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="speed_versus_required_thrust"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_id343543"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598975.png" alt="Speed versus required thrust"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 16-6. Speed versus required thrust</div></div><p>An important physical phenomenon concerning propulsion that you may want to incorporate<a id="I_indexterm2_id343563" class="indexterm"/> is <span class="emphasis"><em>cavitation</em></span>. Cavitation occurs when a propeller is
        moving fast enough that the low-pressure side of the blade starts spontaneously creating
        vapor bubbles. These bubbles exist for a short while, and then as the propeller turns, the
        static pressure changes. This higher static pressure causes the bubbles to collapse
        violently. This collapse is so fast and furious that it can cause metal erosion at a high
        rate. It will eat away at a propeller until it is no longer producing thrust. It is also
        very noisy. That is why submarine propellers are shaped very differently than other ships’
        propellers. They seek to limit cavitations so they’re not heard by enemy vessels. The damage
        caused by cavitation also creates a speed limit on RPMs for a propeller. Cavitation is a
        real-life phenomenon you can exploit to penalize the player for driving around at high speed
        all the time.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Maneuverability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="maneuverability">Maneuverability</h2></div></div></div><p>Another aspect of <a id="sh16.4" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id343610" class="indexterm"/>ships and boats that is often oversimplified is maneuverability. Maneuverability
      is also a very complex topic whose numerical simulation is beyond the current realm of
      real-time simulation. However, with some simplifications and assumptions, it can be more
      accurately modeled than if you do not know the underlying framework. Almost all vessels
      maneuver by way of two methods: rudders or thrust vectoring. The users generally won’t care
      about the differences, so you can model both by angling the thrust vector off-center.</p><div class="sect2" title="Rudders and Thrust Vectoring"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="rudders_and_thrust_vectoring">Rudders and Thrust Vectoring</h3></div></div></div><p>Although <a id="I_indexterm2_id343636" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id343648" class="indexterm"/>rudders and thrust vectoring have the same result, there
      are some important differences. A thrust vectoring system, like a jet
      boat, can steer only when the vessel is producing thrust. A rudder, on
      the other hand, works only when the vessel has forward speed. If the
      boat isn’t moving forward with enough speed, then the rudder can’t
      produce a turning moment.</p><p>If you keep in mind those differences, you can model both systems
      the same way. The most important thing to keep in mind when modeling
      larger ships in your games is that they take significant time to respond
      to control inputs. <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#solidus_10_zig-zag_test" title="Figure 16-7. 10/10 zig-zag test">Figure 16-7</a><a id="I_indexterm2_id343668" class="indexterm"/> tracks the heading of a ship over time during what is
      called the <span class="emphasis"><em>10/10 maneuver</em></span>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="solidus_10_zig-zag_test"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject2_id343693"/><img style="width: 279.92125984252; " src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1598976.png" alt="10/10 zig-zag test"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 16-7. 10/10 zig-zag test</div></div><p>A vessel is moving in a straight line, and the rudder is put over
      10 degrees in one direction. Once the vessel’s heading changes 10
      degrees, the rudder is moved to the opposite side at the same angle. The
      initial turning time is the time it took for the vessel to change its
      heading 10 degrees. As large ships have enormous momentum, they will
      continue to turn even though the rudder is in the opposite direction.
      The maximum deviation from the original heading minus the 10 degrees at
      which the rudder was flipped is called<a id="I_indexterm2_id343720" class="indexterm"/> the <span class="emphasis"><em>overshoot angle</em></span>. The size of
      this angle is one measure of how slow the vessel is to respond to the
      helm. For larger ships, this can be between 15 degrees when light and 45
      degrees when loaded with cargo.</p><p>The time to check yaw is the time in seconds it takes for the
      overshoot angle to be achieved and the vessel to start changing its
      heading again. This is repeated for the other side to detect any bias a
      vessel may have for turning in a particular direction. The moral of the
      story is that for anything other than a high-speed small craft, boats
      and ships can take a significant amount of time to respond to the helm.
      Your simulation should strive to reproduce a turning ability that
      matches <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#solidus_10_zig-zag_test" title="Figure 16-7. 10/10 zig-zag test">Figure 16-7</a> for extra
      realism.</p><p>A special kind of thrust vectoring is <a id="I_indexterm2_id343750" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm2_id343756" class="indexterm"/>called <span class="emphasis"><em>throttle steering</em></span>. Imagine that a boat has two
        engines. If one is run in forward and the other in reverse, the vessel will turn quite
        rapidly. For a twin-engine vessel operating in close quarters, the rudders are often
        centered and the vessel maneuvered solely by altering the throttle settings of the two
        props.</p><div class="sect3" title="Propeller walk"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="propeller_walk">Propeller walk</h4></div></div></div><p>Another interesting <a id="I_indexterm2_id343786" class="indexterm"/>maneuvering phenomenon that is closely related to thrust
        vectoring is called <span class="emphasis"><em>propeller walk</em></span>, or
        <span class="emphasis"><em>prop walk</em></span>. This is especially important for
        vessels with only one propeller moving in tight spaces. The cause of
        propeller walk is related to the fact that most propellers are
        installed at an angle to the horizon. This angle causes the thrust to
        be greater when the blades are moving down than when the blades are
        moving upward. In a propeller that turns clockwise, this creates a
        push to the right.</p><p>In forward gear the rudder is very effective at countering the propeller walk, but in
          reverse the rudder is much less effective, making the propeller walk much more noticeable.
          This can add a significant amount of realism when you are simulating vessels in docking
