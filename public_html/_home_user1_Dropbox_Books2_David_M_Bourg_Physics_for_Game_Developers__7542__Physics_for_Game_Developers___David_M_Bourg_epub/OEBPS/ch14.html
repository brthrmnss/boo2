  you’re trying to simulate using physics-based techniques. For many game
  programmers, a physics engine is a real-time, rigid-body simulator such as
  the sort we’ve discussed earlier in this book. The open source and
  licensable physics engines available to you are typically of the
  rigid-body-simulator variety. Some physics engines are rather generic and
  are useful for general rigid bodies and particles; others include various
  connectors and constraints, enabling ragdoll simulation. Still others focus
  on soft bodies and fluids. Fewer actually focus on the physics of some
  specific thing, like a car or a boat. A simple Internet search on the phrase
  “game physics engine” will generate many links to potential options for your
  use. That said, you could always write your own physics engine.</p><div class="sect1" title="Building Your Own Physics Engine"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="building_your_own_physics_engine">Building Your Own Physics Engine</h2></div></div></div><p>We’re advocates of <a id="ph14.1" class="indexterm"/>using physics where you need it. Sure, you can write a
    general-purpose physics engine for a game, but if you’re creating a game
    that doesn’t require a general-purpose physics engine, then don’t write
    one. That may sound obvious, but sometimes we are compelled to do more
    than what we need just so we can say we did it. Aside from the effort
    <a id="I_indexterm8_id337113" class="indexterm"/>involved, a general-purpose physics engine will probably be
    less efficient than a purpose-built physics engine. By
    <span class="emphasis"><em>purpose-built</em></span>, we <a id="I_indexterm8_id337129" class="indexterm"/>mean designing the physics engine specifically to suit what
    you’re trying to simulate. For example, a general-purpose physics engine
    would surely include particles, rigid bodies, connectors, other force
    effectors, and who knows what else—fluids, perhaps—and be fully 3D. But if
    you’re writing a 2D side-scrolling game for a smartphone, you certainly
    won’t need 3D with the associated complexities involved in dealing with
    rotation and collisions in 3D; and if your game simply involves throwing a
    ball of fuzz at some arbitrary junk, then you may not even need to deal
    with rigid bodies at all. We’re being somewhat facetious here, but the
    point is, unless you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> write a general-purpose
    physics engine—say, if you plan to license it as a middleware product or
    use it in a variety of game types—then don’t write one. Instead, write one
    specifically optimized for the game you’re working on.</p><p>Let’s consider a few examples. Let’s say you’re writing a 3D
    first-person <a id="I_indexterm8_id337154" class="indexterm"/>shooter and you want to use physics to simulate how wooden
    barrels and crates blow apart when shot. Typically, such an effect would
    show pieces of wood flying off in different directions while falling under
    the influence of gravity. You could simulate such an effect in 3D using
    rigid bodies and you wouldn’t even need to consider collisions, unless you
    wanted the pieces to bounce off each other or other objects. Ignoring
    these aspects greatly simplifies the underlying physics engine. Consider
    another example. Let’s say you’re working on a game involving flying an
    airplane. You can use physics to simulate the flight dynamics, as we
    explain in this book, without the need for particles, connectors, or even
    collision response.</p><p>The point of all this discussion is that you should consider which aspects of your game
      will really benefit from physics and write your physics engine to deal specifically with those
      aspects.</p><p>Another thing to consider is whether or not you need real-time physics. You might expect,
      after reading the available game physics literature, that your game must include real-time
      simulations <a id="I_indexterm8_id337183" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337193" class="indexterm"/>if it is to incorporate physics. However, there are many ways to include physics
      in a game without having to solve the physics via real-time simulations. We show you an
      example in <a class="xref" href="ch19.html" title="Chapter 19. Sports">Chapter 19</a> whereby a golf swing is <a id="I_indexterm8_id337211" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337221" class="indexterm"/>simulated in order to determine club head velocity at the time of club-ball
      impact. In this case, given specific initial parameters, we can solve the swing quickly,
      almost instantaneously, to determine the club speed, which can then be used as an initial
      condition for the ball flight. The ball’s flight can be solved quickly as well and not
      necessarily in real time. It really depends on how you want to present the result to the
      player. If your game involves following the flight of the ball as it soars through the air,
      then you might want to simulate its flight in real time so you can realistically move the ball
      and camera. If, however, you simply want to show where the ball ends up, then you need not
      perform the simulation in real time. For such a simple problem, you can solve for the final
      ball location quicker than real time. Sometimes, the action you’re simulating may happen so
      fast in real life that you’ll want to slow it down for your game. Following a golf ball’s
      flight in real time might have the camera moving so fast that your player won’t be able to
      enjoy the beautifully rendered bird’s-eye view of the course. In this case, you rapidly solve
      the flight path, save the data, and then animate the scene at a more enjoyable pace of your
      choosing.</p><p>We don’t want to come across as trying to talk you out of writing a
    physics engine if you so choose. The point of our discussion so far is
    that you simply don’t have to write a generic, real-time physics engine in
    order to use physics in your games. You have other options as we’ve just
    explained.</p><p>Assuming that, after all these considerations, you need to write a
    physics engine, then we have the following to offer.</p><p>A physics engine is just one component of a <a id="I_indexterm8_id337258" class="indexterm"/>game engine. The other components include the graphics engine, audio engine, AI
      engine, and whatever other engines you may require or whatever other components of a game you
      may elevate to the status of engine. Whatever the case, the physics engine handles the
      physics. Depending on whom you talk to, you’ll get different ideas on what composes a physics
      engine. Some will say that the heart of the physics engine is the collision detection module.
      Well, what if your game doesn’t require collision detection, yet it still uses physics to
      simulate certain behaviors or features? Then collision detection certainly cannot be the heart
      of your physics engine. Some programmers will certainly take issue with these statements. To
      them, a physics engine simulates rigid-body motion using Newtonian dynamics while taking care
      of <a id="I_indexterm8_id337273" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337283" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337292" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337302" class="indexterm"/>collision detection and response. To us, a significant component of a physics
      engine is the model—that is, the idealization of the thing you’re trying to simulate in a
      realistic manner. You cannot realistically simulate the flight characteristics of a specific
      aircraft by treating it as a generic rigid body. You have to develop a representative model of
      that aircraft including very specific features; otherwise, it’s a hack (which, by the way, we
      recognize as a valid and long-established approach).</p><p>Earlier, in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Real-Time Simulations">Chapter 7</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Connecting Objects">Chapter 13</a>, we showed you several example <a id="I_indexterm8_id337331" class="indexterm"/>simulations. While simple, these examples include many of the required components
      of a generic physics engine. There are the particle and rigid-body classes that encapsulate
      generic object properties and behaviors, physics models that govern object behaviors,
      collision detection and response systems, and a numerical integrator. Additionally, those
      examples include interfacing the physics code with user input and visual feedback. These
      examples also show the basic flow from user input to physics solver to visual feedback.</p><p>In summary, the major components of a generic physics engine
    <a id="I_indexterm8_id337350" class="indexterm"/>include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Physics models</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Simulated objects manager</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Collision detection engine or interface thereto</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Collision response module</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Force effectors</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Numerical integrator</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Game engine interface</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2" title="Physics Models"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="physics_models">Physics Models</h3></div></div></div><p>Physics models are <a id="I_indexterm8_id337432" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337442" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337452" class="indexterm"/>the idealizations of the things you’re simulating. If your physics engine is a
        generic rigid-body simulator used to simulate an assortment of solid objects your players
        can knock around, throw, shoot, and generally interact with in a basic manner, then the
        physics model will probably be very generic. It’s probably safe to assume that each object
        will be subject to gravity’s pull, thus mass will be an important attribute. Size will also
        be important, not only because you’ll need to know how big things are when checking for
        collisions and handling other interactions, but also because size is related to the
        distribution of the object’s mass. More precisely, each object will <a id="I_indexterm8_id337466" class="indexterm"/>have <span class="emphasis"><em>mass moment of inertia</em></span> attributes. The objects will
        most likely also have some ascribed <a id="I_indexterm8_id337480" class="indexterm"/>coefficient of restitution that will be used during collision response handling.
        Additionally, you might ascribe some friction coefficients <a id="I_indexterm8_id337493" class="indexterm"/>that may be used during collision response or in situations where the objects
        may slide along a floor. As the objects will likely find themselves airborne at some point,
        you’ll probably also include a drag coefficient <a id="I_indexterm8_id337503" class="indexterm"/>for each object. All of these parameters will help you differentiate massive
        objects from lighter ones or compact objects from voluminous ones.</p><p>If your simulation involves more than generic rigid bodies, then
      your physics will be more specific and perhaps far more elaborate. A
      great example of a more complicated model is flight simulation. No
      matter how good your generic rigid-body model, it won’t fly like any
      specific aircraft if it flies at all. You must develop a model that
      captures flight aerodynamics specific to the aircraft you’re simulating.
      <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Aircraft">Chapter 15</a> shows how to put together a model for an
      aircraft that can be used in a real-time flight simulation.</p><p>The other chapters in Part IV of this book are meant to give you a
      taste of modeling aspects for a variety of things you might simulate in
      a game. Just as you cannot simulate an aircraft with a generic
      rigid-body model, you cannot simulate a ship with an aircraft model, nor
      can you simulate a golf ball with a ship model. The point is that you
      must spend some time designing your physics model specific to what
      you’re going to simulate in your game. Time spent here is just as
      important to creating a realistic physics engine as time spent on
      designing a robust integration scheme or collision detection system. We
      can’t overstate the importance of the physical model. The model is what
      defines the behavior of the thing you’re simulating.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Simulated Objects Manager"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="simulated_objects_manager">Simulated Objects Manager</h3></div></div></div><p>Your simulated objects manager will be <a id="I_indexterm8_id337552" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337562" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337568" class="indexterm"/>responsible for instantiating, initializing, and disposing
      of objects. It will also be responsible for maintaining links between
      object physics and other attributes such as geometry, for example, if in
      a 3D simulation you use the same polyhedron to render an object and for
      collision detection and response.</p><p>You must have some means of managing the objects in your simulation. One can imagine
        many different approaches to managing these objects, and unless your simulation uses just a
        handful of objects or fewer, essentially what you need is a list of objects of whatever
        class you’ve defined. You’ve seen in previous chapters’ examples where we use simple arrays
        of <code class="literal">RigidBody</code> type objects or <code class="literal">Particle</code> type objects. If all the objects in your simulation are the same, then
        you need only a single class capturing all their behavior. However, for more diversity, you
        should use a list of various classes with each class encapsulating the code required to
        implement its own physical model. This is particularly important with respect to the forces
        acting on the model. For example, you could have some objects representing projectiles with
        others representing aircraft. These different classes will share some common code (for
        example, collision detection); however, the way forces are computed on each will vary due to
        the differences in how they are modeled. With such an approach, each class must have code
        that implements its particular model. During integration, the entire list will be traversed,
        calling the force aggregation method for each object, and the particular class will handle
        the details suitable for the type of object.</p><p>In some simple cases, you need not use different object classes if
      the types of objects you plan to use are not too different. For example,
      it would be fairly straightforward to implement a single class capable
      of handling both particles and rigid bodies. The object class could
      include an object type property used to denote whether the object is a
      particle or a rigid body, and then the class methods would call the
      appropriate code. Again, this will work satisfactorily for simple
      objects with few differences. If you want to simulate more than two
      types of objects or if they are very different, you’re probably better
      off using different classes specific to each object being
      simulated.</p><p>However you structure your classes or lists, the flow of
      processing your objects will generally be the same. Every physics
      <span class="emphasis"><em>tick</em></span>—that is, every time step in the physics
      simulation—you must check for object collisions, resolve those
      collisions, aggregate the usual forces on each object, integrate the
      equations of motion for each object, and then update each object’s
      state.</p><p>As we said, this is the general flow at every physics tick, or
      time step, which may not be the same as your <a id="I_indexterm8_id337634" class="indexterm"/>rendering steps. For example, for accuracy in your
      simulation you may have to take small steps around a millisecond or so.
      You wouldn’t want to update the graphics every millisecond when you need
      only about a third as many graphics updates per second. Thus, your
      objects manager will have to be integrated with your overall game
      engine, and your game engine must be responsible for making sure the
      physics and graphics are updated appropriately.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Collision Detection"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="collision_detection">Collision Detection</h3></div></div></div><p>If collisions are an <a id="I_indexterm8_id337663" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337673" class="indexterm"/>important part of your game, then a robust collision
      detection system is required.</p><p>Your collision detection system is distinct from the collision
      response system or module, though the two go hand in hand. Collision
      detection <a id="I_indexterm8_id337690" class="indexterm"/>is the computational geometry problem of determining if
      objects collide and, if so, what points are making contact. These points
      are sometimes called <a id="I_indexterm8_id337702" class="indexterm"/>the <span class="emphasis"><em>contact manifold</em></span>. They’re just
      the points that are touching, which could be a line or surface, though
      for simplicity usually the point, end points, or points defining the
      contact surface boundary are all that are included in the contact
      manifold.</p><p>The collision detection system’s role is very specific: determine
      which objects are colliding, what points on each object are involved in
      the collision, and the velocities of those points. It sounds
      straightforward, but actual implementation can get quite complex. There
      are situations where fast-moving objects may go right though other
      objects, especially thin ones, over a single time step, making the
      <a id="I_indexterm8_id337724" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337734" class="indexterm"/>collision detection system miss the collision if it relies
      solely on checking the separation distance between objects and their
      relative velocity (i.e., it detects a collision if the objects are
      within some collision tolerance and are also moving toward each other).
      A robust collision detection system will capture this situation and
      respond accordingly. In <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Particles">Chapter 8</a> we simply check if
      particles moved past the ground over the course of a single time step,
      for example, and then reset their position to that of the ground plane
      level. We can handle many situations using such simple techniques,
      especially when dealing with objects passing through floors or walls;
      however, other situations may require more complex algorithms to predict
      if a collision will occur sometime in the near future depending on how
      fast objects are moving relative to each other. This latter case is
      <a id="I_indexterm8_id337758" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337764" class="indexterm"/>called <span class="emphasis"><em>continuous</em></span> collision
      detection, and it is covered in many Internet, book, and technical paper
      sources. Many commercial and open source physics engines advertise their
      capability to handle continuous collision detection.</p><p>Another challenge associated with collision detection is the fact
      that it can be very time-consuming if you have a large or even moderate
      number of objects in your simulation. There are various techniques to
      deal with this. First, the <a id="I_indexterm8_id337785" class="indexterm"/>game space is partitioned in some coarse grid-like manner,
      and this grid is used to organize objects depending on which cell they
      occupy. Then, in the second phase of collision detection, only those
      <a id="I_indexterm8_id337794" class="indexterm"/>objects occupying adjacent cells are checked against each
      other to see if they are colliding. Without this grid partitioning,
      pairwise checks of every object against every other object would be very
      computationally expensive. The second phase of collision detection is
      often a broad approach using <a id="I_indexterm8_id337808" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337814" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337824" class="indexterm"/>bounding spheres or bounding boxes, which may be axis- or
      body-aligned. If the bounding spheres or boxes of each object are found
      to collide, then the objects likewise may be colliding and further
      checks will be required; otherwise, we can infer that the objects are
      not colliding. In the case of a potential collision, these further
      checks become more complex depending on the geometry of the objects.
      This phase generally involves polygon- and vertex-level checks; there
      are well-established techniques for performing such checks that we won’t
      get into here. Again, there’s a wealth of literature on collision
      detection available online.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Collision Response"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="collision_response">Collision Response</h3></div></div></div><p>Once the collision <a id="I_indexterm8_id337849" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337860" class="indexterm"/>detection system does its job, it’s time for the collision
      response system to deal with the colliding objects. Earlier in this
      book, we showed you how to implement an <a id="I_indexterm8_id337872" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337879" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337889" class="indexterm"/>impulse-moment collision response method. Recall that this
      method assumes that at the instant of collision, the most significant
      forces acting on the objects are the collision forces, so all other
      forces can be ignored for that instant. The method then computes the
      resulting velocities of the objects after colliding and instantly
      changes their velocities accordingly. To perform the required
      calculations, the collision response system requires the objects
      colliding, of course, the collision points, and the velocities of those
      points. Also, each object must have some associated mass and <a id="I_indexterm8_id337905" class="indexterm"/>coefficient of restitution, which are likewise used to
      compute the resulting velocities of the objects after the
      collision.</p><p>In practice, the collision response system works <a id="I_indexterm8_id337921" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337931" class="indexterm"/>hand in hand with the collision detection system,
      particularly when dealing with objects that may be penetrating each
      other. As we mentioned earlier, in many cases an object <a id="I_indexterm8_id337944" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id337950" class="indexterm"/>penetrating another, such as an object penetrating a wall
      or floor, can simply be moved so that it is just touching the wall or
      floor. Other cases may be more complicated, and iterative algorithms are
      used to resolve the penetration. For example, if penetration is
      detected, then the simulation may back up to the previous time step and
      take a short time step to see if penetration still occurs. If it does
      not, the simulation proceeds; otherwise, the simulation takes an even
      smaller time step. This process repeats until penetration does not
      occur. This works fine in many cases; however, sometimes the penetration
      is never resolved and the simulation could get stuck taking smaller and
      smaller time steps. This failure to resolve could be attributed to
      objects that are just outside the collision distance tolerance at one
      instant, and due to numerical errors, exceedingly small time steps are
      required to stay outside of the <a id="I_indexterm8_id337969" class="indexterm"/>distance tolerance. Some programmers simply put an
      iteration limit in the code to prevent the simulation from getting
      stuck, but the consequences in every situation may be unpredictable. The
      continuous collision detection approach we mentioned earlier avoids this
      sort of problem by predicting the future collision or penetration and
      dealing with it ahead of time. Whatever the approach, there will be some
      back and forth and data exchange between your collision detection and
      response systems to avoid excessive penetration situations.</p><p>Additionally, there are situations when an object may come to rest
      in contact with another—for example, a box resting on the floor. There
      are many ways to deal with such <a id="I_indexterm8_id337988" class="indexterm"/>contact situations, one of which is to just allow the
      impulse-momentum approach to deal with it. This works just fine in many
      cases; however, sometimes the objects in resting contact will jitter
      with the impulse-momentum approach. One resolution to this jittering
      problem is to put those <a id="I_indexterm8_id338002" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id338012" class="indexterm"/>objects to sleep—that is, if they are found to be
      colliding, but their relative velocities are smaller than some
      tolerance, they are put to sleep. A related but somewhat more
      complicated approach is to compute the contact normal between the object
      and the floor and set that velocity to 0. This serves as a constraint,
      preventing the object from penetrating the floor while still allowing it
      to slide along the floor.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Force Effectors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="force_effectors">Force Effectors</h3></div></div></div><p>Force effectors <a id="I_indexterm8_id338037" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id338047" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id338053" class="indexterm"/>apply direct or indirect force on the objects in your
      simulations. Your physics engine may include several. For example, if
      your engine allows users to move objects around with the mouse, then
      you’ll need some virtualization of the force applied by the user via the
      mouse or a finger on a touch screen. This is an example of a direct
      force. Another <a id="I_indexterm8_id338068" class="indexterm"/>direct force effector could be a virtual jet engine. If
      you associate that virtual engine, which produces some thrust force,
      with some object, then the associated object will behave as though it
      were pushed around by the jet.</p><p>Some examples of indirect force effectors<a id="I_indexterm8_id338081" class="indexterm"/> include gravity and wind. <a id="I_indexterm8_id338089" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id338101" class="indexterm"/>Gravity applies force on objects by virtue of their mass,
      but it is typically modeled as body acceleration and not an explicit
      force. Wind can be viewed as exerting a pressure force on an object, and
      that force will be a function of the object’s size and drag
      coefficients.</p><p>You can imagine all sorts of force effectors, from ones similar to
      those just described to perhaps some otherworldly ones. Whatever you
      imagine, you must remember that a force has magnitude, direction, and
      some central point of application. If you put a jet engine on the side
      of a box, the box will not only translate but will spin as well. Wind
      creates a force that has a<a id="I_indexterm8_id338124" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id338130" class="indexterm"/> center of pressure, which is the point through which you
      can assume the total wind force acts. The direction of the force and
      point of application are important for capturing both translation and
      rotation. As an example, consider the <a id="I_indexterm8_id338143" class="indexterm"/>hovercraft we modeled in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. 2D Rigid-Body Simulator">Chapter 9</a> that included two bow thrusters for
      steering and a propeller for forward motion. Each of these direct force
      effectors—the bow thrusters and the propeller—is applied at specific
      locations on the hovercraft. The bow thrusters are located toward the
      bow and point sideways in order to create spin, thus allowing some
      steering. The propeller is located on the center line of the hovercraft,
      which passes through the hovercraft’s center of gravity so that it does
      not create spin and instead simply pushes the craft forward. There’s
      another force effector in <a id="I_indexterm8_id338164" class="indexterm"/>that model—aerodynamic drag, which is an indirect force
      effector. The drag force is applied at a point aft of the center of
      gravity so that it creates some torque, or moment, which in this model
      helps keep the hovercraft pointed straight; it provides some directional
      stability.</p><p>Whatever force effectors you contrive, they all must be aggregated
      for each object and dealt with in your numerical integrator. Thus, your
      integrator must have some means of accessing all the force effector
      information required to accurately simulate their effect on each
      associated object.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Numerical Integrator"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="numerical_integrator">Numerical Integrator</h3></div></div></div><p>The integrator is responsible <a id="I_indexterm8_id338197" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id338208" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id338214" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id338225" class="indexterm"/>for solving the equations of motion for each object. We
      showed you how to do this earlier, in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Real-Time Simulations">Chapter 7</a> through <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Connecting Objects">Chapter 13</a>. In your generic physics engine you’ll
      iterate through all the objects in the simulation to compute their new
      velocities, positions, and orientations at every time step. To make
      these calculations, your integrator must have access to the force
      effectors associated with each object. The forces will be used to
      compute accelerations, which will then be integrated to compute
      velocities, and those in turn will be used to compute positions and
      orientations.</p><p>You can handle aggregating the <a id="I_indexterm8_id338253" class="indexterm"/>forces in a few ways. You could aggregate all the forces on all objects prior to
        looping through the objects integrating the equations of motion, but this would require
        looping through all the objects twice. Alternatively, since you’re looping through the
        object list in order to integrate each object’s equations of motion, you can simply
        aggregate each <a id="I_indexterm8_id338268" class="indexterm"/>object’s forces during the integration step. A complication arises when object
        pairs apply forces to each other. A linear spring and damper, for example, connected between
        two objects, apply equal and opposite forces to each object. The force is a function of the
        relative distance between the objects (the spring component) and their relative velocity
        (the damping component). So, if during a given time step you aggregate the forces on one of
        the objects in the pair, the resulting force will be a function of the current relative
        position and velocities of the objects. Integrating that object will give it a new position
        and velocity. Then, when you get to the other object in the pair, if you recomputed the
        spring force, it will be a function of the new relative position and velocity between the
        objects that includes the new displacement and velocity of the previously updated object but
        the old displacement and velocity of the current object. This is inconsistent with Newton’s
        law of <a id="I_indexterm8_id338288" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id338298" class="indexterm"/><a id="I_indexterm8_id338308" class="indexterm"/>equal and opposite forces. You can resolve this problem by storing the force
        computed for the first object and applying it to the second one without recomputing the
        spring force for the second object.</p></div></div></section></body></html>
