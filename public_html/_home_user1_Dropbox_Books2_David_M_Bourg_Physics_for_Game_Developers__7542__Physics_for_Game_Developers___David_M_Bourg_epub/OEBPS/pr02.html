      mechanics or physics background, charged with the task of incorporating <span class="emphasis"><em>real
        physics</em></span> in their games. </p><p>As a game developer, and very likely as a gamer yourself, you’ve seen products being
      advertised as “ultra-realistic,” or as using “real-world physics.” At the same time you, or
      perhaps your company’s marketing department, are wondering how you can spice up your own games
      with such realism. Or perhaps you want to try something completely new that requires you to
      explore real physics. The only problem is that you threw your college physics text in the lake
      after final exams and haven’t touched the subject since. Maybe you licensed a really cool
      physics engine, but you have no idea how the underlying principles work and how they will
      affect what you’re trying to model. Or, perhaps you are charged with the task of tuning
      someone else’s physics code but you really don’t understand how it works. Well then, this book
      is for you. </p><p>Sure you could scour the Internet, trade journals, and magazines for information and
      how-to’s on adding physics-based realism to your games. You could even fish out that old
      physics text and start from scratch. However, you’re likely to find that either the material
      is too general to be applied directly, or too advanced requiring you to search for other
      sources to get up to speed on the basics. This book will pull together the information you
      need and will serve as the starting point for you, the game developer, in your effort to
      enrich your game’s content with physics-based realism. </p><p>This book is not a recipe book that simply gives sample code for a miscellaneous set of
      problems. The Internet is full of such example programs (some very good ones we might add).
      Rather than give you a collection of specific solutions to specific problems, our aim is to
      arm you with a thorough and fundamental understanding of the relevant topics such that you can
      formulate your own solutions to a variety of problems. We’ll do this by explaining, in detail,
      the principles of physics applicable to game development, and by providing complimentary hand
      calculation examples in addition to sample programs. </p></div><div class="sect1" title="What We Assume You Know"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="I_sect1_id286370">What We Assume You Know</h2></div></div></div><p> Although we don’t assume that you are a physics expert, we do assume that you have at
      least a basic college level understanding of classical physics typical of non-physics and
      non-engineering majors. It is not essential that your physics background is fresh in your mind
      as the first several chapters of this book review the subjects relevant to game physics. </p><p>We also assume that you are proficient in trigonometry, vector, and matrix math, although
      we do include reference material in the appendices. Further, we assume that you have at least
      a basic college level understanding of calculus, including integration and differentiation of
      explicit functions. Numerical integration and differentiation is a different story, and we
      cover these techniques in detail in the later chapters of this book. </p></div><div class="sect1" title="Mechanics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="I_sect1_id286399">Mechanics</h2></div></div></div><p> Most people that we’ve talked to when we was developing the concept for this book
      immediately thought of flight simulators when the phrases “real physics” and “real-time
      simulation” came up. Certainly cutting edge flight simulations are relevant in this context;
      however, many different types of games, and specific game elements, stand to benefit from
      physics-based realism. </p><p>Consider this example: You’re working on the next blockbuster hunting game complete with
      first-person 3D, beautiful textures, and an awesome sound track to set the mood, but something
      is missing. That something is realism. Specifically, you want the game to “feel” more real by
      challenging the gamer’s marksmanship, and you want to do this by adding considerations such as
      distance to target, wind speed and direction, and muzzle velocity, among others. Moreover, you
      don’t want to fake these elements, but rather, you’d like to realistically model them based on
      the principles of physics. Gary Powell, with MathEngine Plc, put it like this “The illusion
      and immersive experience of the virtual world, so carefully built up with high polygon models,
      detailed textures and advanced lighting, is so often shattered as soon as objects start to
      move and interact.”<sup>[<a id="id326051" href="#ftn.id326051" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup> “It’s all about interactivity and immersiveness,” says Dr. Steven Collins, CEO of Havok.com.<sup>[<a id="id309949" href="#ftn.id309949" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">2</a>]</sup> We think both these guys or right on target. Why invest so much time and effort
      making your game world look as realistic as possible, but not take the extra step to make it
      behave just as realistically? </p><p>Here are a few examples of specific game elements that stand to benefit, in terms of
      realism, from the use of real physics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The trajectory of rockets and missiles including the effects of fuel burn off</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The collision of objects such as billiard balls </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The effects of gravitation between large objects such as planets and battle stations
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The stability of cars racing around tight curves </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The dynamics of boats and other waterborne vehicles </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The flight path of a baseball after being struck by a bat </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The flight of a playing card being tossed into a hat </p></li></ul></div><p>This is by no means an exhaustive list, but just a few examples to get you in the right
      frame of mind, so to speak. Pretty much anything in your games that bounces around, flies,
      rolls, slides, or isn’t sitting dead still can be realistically modeled to create compelling,
      believable content for your games. </p><p>So how can this realism be achieved? By using physics, of course, which brings us back to
      the title of this section, the subject of <span class="emphasis"><em>mechanics</em></span>. Physics is a vast
      field of science that covers many different, but related subjects. The subject most applicable
      to realistic game content is the subject of mechanics, which is really what’s meant by “real
      physics.” </p><p>By definition, mechanics is the study of bodies at rest and in motion, and of the effect
      of forces on them. The subject of mechanics is subdivided into <span class="emphasis"><em>statics</em></span>,
      which specifically focuses on bodies at rest, and <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamics</em></span>, which focuses
      on bodies in motion. One of the oldest and most studied subjects of physics, the formal
      origins of mechanics can be traced back more than 2000 years to Aristotle. An even earlier
      treatment of the subject was formalized in <span class="emphasis"><em>Problems of Mechanics</em></span>, but the
      origins of this work are unknown. Although some of these early works attributed some physical
      phenomena to magical elements, the contributions of such great minds as Galileo, Kepler,
      Euler, Lagrange, d’Alembert, Newton, and Einstein, to name a few, have helped develop our
      understanding of this subject to such a degree that we have been able to achieve the
      remarkable state of technological advancement that we see today. </p><p>Because you want your game content to be alive and active, we’ll primarily look at bodies
      in motion and will thus delve into the details of the subject of dynamics. Within the subject
      of dynamics there are even more specific subjects to investigate, namely,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>kinematics</em></span>, which focuses on the motion of bodies without regard to the
      forces that act on the body, and <span class="emphasis"><em>kinetics</em></span>, which considers both the
      motion of bodies and the forces that act on or otherwise affect bodies in motion. We’ll take a
      very close look at these two subjects throughout this book. </p></div><div class="sect1" title="Digital Physics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="I_sect1_id286570">Digital Physics</h2></div></div></div><p>This book’s first edition focused exclusively on mechanics. More than a decade after its
      release we’ve broadened our definition of game physics to include <span class="emphasis"><em>digital
        physics</em></span> not in the cosmological sense but in the context of the physics
      associated with such devices as smart phones and their unique user interaction experience. As
      more platforms such as the Wii, PlayStation, X Box and smart phones come out and are expanded
      developers will have to keep up with and understand the new input and sensors technologies
      that accompany these platforms in order to keep producing fresh gaming experiences. But you
      shouldn’t look at this as a burden, and instead look at it as an opportunity to enhance the
      user’s interactive experience with your games. </p></div><div class="sect1" title="Arrangement of This Book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="I_sect1_id286592">Arrangement of This Book</h2></div></div></div><p> Physics-based realism is not new to gaming, and in fact many games on the shelves these
      days advertise their physics engines. Also, many 3D modeling and animation tools have physics
      engines built in to help realistically animate specific types of motion. Naturally, there are
      magazine articles that appear every now and then that discuss various aspects of physics-based
      game content. In parallel, but at a different level, research in the area of real-time rigid body<sup>[<a id="id328167" href="#ftn.id328167" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup> simulation has been active for many years, and the technical journals are full of
      papers that deal with various aspects of this subject. You’ll find papers on subjects ranging
      from the simulation of multiple, connected rigid bodies to the simulation of cloth. However,
      while these are fascinating subjects and valuable resources, as we hinted earlier, many of
      them are of limited immediate use to the game developer as they first require a solid
      understanding of the subject of mechanics requiring you to learn the basics from other
      sources. Further, many of them focus primarily on the mathematics involved in solving the
      equations of motion and don’t address the practical treatment of the forces acting on the body
      or system being simulated. </p><p>We asked John Nagle, with Animats, what is, in his opinion, the most difficult part of
      developing a physics-based simulation for games and his response was developing numerically
      stable, robust code.<sup>[<a id="id149326" href="#ftn.id149326" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup> Gary Powell echoed this when he told me that minimizing the amount of parameter
      tuning to produce stable, realistic behavior was one of the most difficult challenges. We
      agree; speed and robustness in dealing with the mathematics of bodies in motion are crucial
      elements of a simulator. And on top of that, so are completeness and accuracy in representing
      the interacting forces that initiate and perpetuate the simulation in the first place. As
      you’ll see later in this book, forces govern the behavior of objects in your simulation and
      you need to model them accurately if your objects are to behave realistically. </p><p>This prerequisite understanding of mechanics and the real world nature of forces that may
      act on a particular body or system have governed the organization of this book. Generally,
      this book is organized in four parts with each building on the material covered in previous
      parts: </p><p>

              interact with game elements, for example, the Wii balance board uses pressure sensors
              allowing players to interact with the Wii Fit game. This chapter will explain the
              physics behind such pressure sensors, what data they generate, and how to manipulate
              that data for game interaction.</p></dd></dl></div><p>

              displays, and looking forward to holography and volumetric displays, developers will

    </p><p><a class="xref" href="pt01.html" title="Part I. Fundamentals">Part I</a> focuses on fundamental topics in
      Newtonian mechanics such as kinematics and kinetics. Kinematics deals with the motion of
      objects. We’ll cover both linear and angular velocity and acceleration. Kinetics deals with
      forces and resulting motion. Part I serves as a primer for <a class="xref" href="pt02.html" title="Part II. Rigid-Body Dynamics">Part II</a> that covers rigid body dynamics. Readers already versed in
      classical mechanics can skip <a class="xref" href="pt01.html" title="Part I. Fundamentals">Part I</a> without loss
      of continuity.</p><p><a class="xref" href="pt02.html" title="Part II. Rigid-Body Dynamics">Part II</a> focuses on rigid body dynamics and
      development of both single and multi-body simulations. This part covers numerical integration,
      real-time simulation of particles and rigid bodies, and connected rigid bodies. Generally,
      this part covers what most game programmers consider elements of a physics engine. </p><p><a class="xref" href="pt03.html" title="Part III. Physical Modeling">Part III</a> focuses on physical modeling. The aim
      of this part is to provide valuable physical insight for the reader so they can make better
      judgments on what to include in their models and what they can safely leave out without
      sacrificing physical realism. We cannot and do not attempt to cover all the possible things
      you might want to simulate. Instead we cover several typical things you may try to simulate in
      a game such as aircraft, boats, sports balls, among others with the purpose of giving you some
      insight into the physical nature of those things and some of the choices you must make when
      developing suitable models. </p><p><a class="xref" href="pt04.html" title="Part IV. Digital Physics">Part IV</a> covers digital physics in a broad
      sense. This is an exciting topic as it relates to the technologies associated with mobile
      platforms, such as smart phones like the iPhone, and ground breaking game systems such as the
      Nentendo Wii. Chapters in this part of the book will explain the physics behind
      accelerometers, touch screens, GPS and other gizmos showing the reader how to leverage these
      elements in their games. We recognize that these topics are not what most game programmers
      typically think about when they think of game physics; however, the technologies covered play
      an increasingly important role in modern mobile games and we feel it important to explain the
      underlying physics behind them with the hope that you’ll be better able to leverage these
      technologies in your games. </p><p>In addition to resources pertaining to real-time simulations, the <a class="link" href="apd.html" title="Appendix D. Bibliography">Bibliography</a> at the end of this book will provide sources of information on
      mechanics, mathematics, and other specific technical subjects, such as books on
      aerodynamics.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Conventions Used in This Book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="I_sect1_id286597">Conventions Used in This Book</h2></div></div></div><p>The following typographical conventions are used in this book:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Constant width</code></span></dt><dd><p>Used to indicate command-line computer output, code examples, Registry keys, and
